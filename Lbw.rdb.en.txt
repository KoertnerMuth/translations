Multiple lines define a logical OR relation, i.e. access is allowed if ONE of the available lines allow access.\n\nA negation inverts the meaning of the calendar, i.e. access will be denied instead of granted at the times appearing in the calendar.

=IDD_B2B_SETUP_R1_STATICTXT5(1)	3. If the verification was successful, your new public key will be signed electronically and will be published for download in the B2B network.
=IDD_B2B_SETUP_R1_STATICTXT6(1)	Caution: The authorisation process is not free of charge! If you don't want to create a new cryptographic key, you must cancel the process now.

=M_PRINTVERSION(0) Print Version

=M_DISCLAIMER_P1(0)	LOCKBASE was developed by Körtner & Muth GmbH. In many companies it stands the test of every day usage. However, in no event the Körtner & Muth GmbH or its suppliers shall be liable for any damages whatsoever arising out of the use of or the inability to use this product. 

=M_DISCLAIMER_P2(0)	This manual was written carefully, but the correctness in every detail can not be warranted. 

=M_INTRO(0)	I. Introduction 

=M_INTRO_P1(0)	LOCKBASE is a modern software for administration and calculation of even most complex master key systems. Work that hitherto has often cost a considerable effort of organisation and competence will be simplified by LOCKBASE (and a PC). Besides the program is also for computer beginners easy to operate because of the Windows graphical user interface. 

=M_INTRO_P2(0)	LOCKBASE is subdivided in several parts which should satisfy the various tasks handling master key systems. Corresponding to the different requirements, LOCKBASE is available in a series of program versions. These could be added to or could be combined as required. 

=M_INTRO_P3(0)	LOCKBASE Manager / Manager Lite 

=M_INTRO_P4(0)	Four data stocks and their relations 

=M_INTRO_P5(0)	Usually customers of master key systems are interested in the administration of four data bases: Persons or key holders, keys, cylinders and doors. One say also four data stocks. Even more important are the direct or indirect relations existing between these four data bases. 

=M_INTRO_P5_A(0)	What person has what key and is able to open what door? 

=M_INTRO_P5_B(0)	What cylinder can be operated by a certain key? 

=M_INTRO_P5_C(0)	What keys operate on a certain cylinder? 

=M_INTRO_P5_D(0)	What cylinder is installed in what door? 

=M_INTRO_P6(0)	All these questions can be answered by the LOCKBASE w{Manager} versions efficiently and reliably. Developed for end user clients of master key systems, these versions are besides other points able to administer e.g. the issue and the return of keys or print key and cylinder orders. 

=M_INTRO_P7(0)	LOCKBASE Administrator 

=M_INTRO_P8(0)	In addition to the basic database operations the program version LOCKBASE w{Administrator} offers the possibility of setting up tabulated system matrices. With their aid the key functionality can be designated and displayed very easily. This version of LOCKBASE is suitable especially for locksmiths, because the technical data e.g. combinations can be entered and altered. 

=M_INTRO_P9(0)	LOCKBASE Calculator 

=M_INTRO_P10(0)	The program version LOCKBASE w{Calculator} serves to calculate master key systems. Most European cylinder brands are supported by LOCKBASE. Furthermore the data bases keys and cylinders can be administered as well as system matrices can be created. Manufacturers of master key systems reduce the expenditure of time considerably to calculate master key systems with the LOCKBASE w{Calculator}. Of course, wrong fits are not possible anymore because there could not be any calculation faults. 

=M_INTRO_P11(0)	LOCKBASE Professional 

=M_INTRO_P12(0)	This version of LOCKBASE serves everything that is desired by manufacturers of master key systems for the planning, calculation and administration of master key systems. It contains the four w{Data Lists}->LST data bases, the w{System Matrix}->MTRX, the w{Calculator}->CALC with w{Code Group Administration}->CALC_CGA and the w{System Designer}->DSGN. With the aid of the w{System Designer} hierarchical master key systems can be structured and entered in an easy way. Subgroups of a master key system can be calculated separately so that the size and the partition of the key bitting array could be improved easily. 

=M_INTRO_CONVENTIONS(0)	1. About this manual 

=M_INTRO_CONVENTIONS_P1(0)	This manual is subdivided in several parts: 

=M_INTRO_CONVENTIONS_P1_A(0)	The introduction contains general remarks on LOCKBASE, on the requirements (hardware, software, installation) and on the handling of the graphic user interface Windows. 

=M_INTRO_CONVENTIONS_P1_B(0)	The {'First Steps into LOCKBASE'}->FSTEP serves as a tutorial to the basic LOCKBASE features. 

=M_INTRO_CONVENTIONS_P1_C(0)	The descriptions to operate LOCKBASE which are arranged in relation to the parts of the program parts: The w{Main Window}->MAIN, the {Main dialogue Boxes}->DLG, the w{Data Lists}->LST, the w{System Matrix}->MTRX, the w{Calculator}->CALC and the w{System Designer}->DSGN as well as the {Print Outs}->PRN will be explained in own chapters. 

=M_INTRO_CONVENTIONS_P1_D(0)	Appended is a glossary where the most important terms not only concerning LOCKBASE, but also concerning PC-operating in general will be explained. 

=M_INTRO_CONVENTIONS_P2(0)	This manual uses the following document conventions: 

=M_INTRO_CONVENTIONS_P2_A(0)	Commands: m{bold}, e.g. m{File - Open}. The first word indicates the name of the menu and the second (and possibly more) indicates the name of the option. 

=M_INTRO_CONVENTIONS_P2_B(0)	Buttons, entry fields, lists and other controls: f{underlined}, e.g. f{OK}, f{Filename}. 

=M_INTRO_CONVENTIONS_P2_C(0)	Windows- and dialogue box names: w{italic}, e.g. w{Data Lists}. 

=M_INTRO_CONVENTIONS_P2_D(0)	Key designations: k{Small caps}, e.g. k{Enter}. A '+' (plus) in-between two key names means that the first key has to be pressed and hold until the second is entered, e.g. k{Shift+Enter}. A '-' (hyphen) in-between two key names indicates whereas that the keys should be pressed after each other, e.g. k{Alt-D-F}. 

=M_INTRO_CONVENTIONS_P2_E(0)	Text, that is logically to replace: [in square brackets], e.g. k{Alt}+[hotkey]. 

=M_INTRO_INSTALL(0)	2. Installation 

=M_INTRO_INSTALL_P1(0)	Using LOCKBASE, you need: 

=M_INTRO_INSTALL_P1_A(0)	an IBM- or 100% compatible PC with an INTEL 80386 processor (or higher), at least 4 MB RAM and a VGA compatible video card (or higher) with corresponding monitor, 

=M_INTRO_INSTALL_P1_B(0)	at least 20 MB free hard disk space (recommended); LOCKBASE needs only a part of it. The real requirement depends on the number and size of saved master key systems, 

=M_INTRO_INSTALL_P1_C(1)	the PC operating system Microsoft Windows 2000/XP/Win7/Win8. Microsoft Windows has to be installed already on your computer. 

=M_INTRO_INSTALL_P1_D(0)	a mouse and a printer (recommended). 

=M_INTRO_INSTALL_P2(0)	To be able to exchange data via internet (B2B, LOCKBASE-Update Service) you need 

=M_INTRO_INSTALL_P2_A(0)	internet access and a Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 (or higher). The Internet Explorer has to be installed already on your computer. 

=M_INTRO_INSTALL_INSTALL(0)	Installing the Program Files 

=M_INTRO_INSTALL_INSTALL_P1(1)	Before starting your work with LOCKBASE, you have to install the program. You will find an installation program 'Setup.exe' on the LOCKBASE installation CD. 

=M_INTRO_INSTALL_INSTALL_P2(0)	After the installation, when LOCKBASE is running for the first time, it has to be unlocked for the use on your computer (via a phone call, fax or email). 

=M_INTRO_INSTALL_INSTALL_P3(1)	Besides LOCKBASE itself the installation CD contains an installation program. Proceed the following steps to start the installation program: 

=M_INTRO_INSTALL_INSTALL_P3_A(0)	Switch on your PC and let Windows start up (if not already done). 

=M_INTRO_INSTALL_INSTALL_P3_B(1)	Put the LOCKBASE data carrier into the respective drive. If you install from CD, now the setup program should be started automatically. If this happens, you can skip the following steps. If you install a download, simply run the downloaded file itself (e.g. 'Lockbae.exe') and skip the following steps.

=M_INTRO_INSTALL_INSTALL_P3_C(1)	If the setup program does not start automatically select the command m{Run} from the Windows m{Start} menu. If you don't have a start menu (e.g. Windows 8), you will find a resp. input field at the bottom bar of the desktop.

=M_INTRO_INSTALL_INSTALL_P3_D(1)	Enter in the field f{Open} the designation of your CD drive (e.g. D:) and then "setup.exe". E.g.: "d:setup.exe". (Capital- and small letters could be used, quotation marks and blanks should not be used.) 

=M_INTRO_INSTALL_INSTALL_P3_E(1)	Press k{Enter} to start the setup program.

=M_INTRO_INSTALL_INSTALL_P4(1)	At first, the setup program checks if there already is a LOCKBASE installation. If so, you could update it. Otherwise you will be requested to enter program and data folder as targets for the LOCKBASE installation. In case you do not accept the suggestion, you have the possibility to select different installation targets. Please note, that all designated LOCKBASE users must have read !{and write} access to the data folder.

=M_INTRO_INSTALL_INSTALL_P5(0)	The setup program copies the LOCKBASE files to your hard disk, creates a folder 'Lockbase' in the m{Programs} section of the Windows m{Start} menu and inserts the LOCKBASE icon.

=M_INTRO_INSTALL_INSTALL_P6(0)	The LOCKBASE Icon: 

=M_INTRO_INSTALL_INSTALL_P7(0)	To create a LOCKBASE network installation, choose shared folders on a file server as installation targets. In this case it s not required to install LOCKBASE on every user's workstation again. Simply create a desktop link to the executable file 'Lbw.exe' for each LOCKBASE user.

=M_INTRO_INSTALL_INSTALL_P8(0) The data folder requested during setup will contain user defined data, which are not included in the LOCKBASE distribution and therefore, in case of an emergency, cannot be recreated by re-installing LOCKBASE. For this reason it is important to !{include the contents of the LOCKBASE data folder in your daily data backup}.

=M_INTRO_INSTALL_START(0)	Starting LOCKBASE 

=M_INTRO_INSTALL_START_P1(0)	To start LOCKBASE proceed the following steps: 

=M_INTRO_INSTALL_START_P1_A(0)	Turn on your PC and let Windows start up (if not already done). 

=M_INTRO_INSTALL_START_P1_B(0)	Click on 'Start' on the bottom left border of the screen. The Windows m{Start} menu opens. 

=M_INTRO_INSTALL_START_P1_C(0)	Move the mouse cursor to the entry m{Programs}, then to m{Lockbase} and click onto m{LOCKBASE} inside the folder. 

=M_INTRO_INSTALL_START_P2(0)	If the LOCKBASE user administration is active, first the login dialogue appears (see Chap. I-2, {'Log on to LOCKBASE'}->INTRO_INSTALL_LOGIN). Enter your password and click f{OK}. After a short moment the LOCKBASE w{Main Window} appears on the screen and LOCKBASE is ready to go.

=M_INTRO_INSTALL_UNLOCK(0)	Unlocking LOCKBASE 

=M_INTRO_INSTALL_UNLOCK_P1(0)	The program has to be unlocked during its first start up. In that case at first a licence dialogue appears instead of the w{main window}. 

=M_INTRO_INSTALL_UNLOCK_P2(0)	The LOCKBASE licencing dialogue 

=M_INTRO_INSTALL_UNLOCK_P3(1)	To unlock LOCKBASE, you have to enter an unlock code matching the displayed licence code. This unlock code can be retrieved from Körtner & Muth GmbH in Hamburg via phone, fax or email after LOCKBASE has been installed. 

=M_INTRO_INSTALL_UNLOCK_P4(1)	The licence code depends on the user running the program. Because of this, a user can run LOCKBASE from any computer in the network as long as his/her Windows user identity is the same and was licenced for the resp. installation.

=M_INTRO_INSTALL_UNLOCK_P5(0)	Note: 

=M_INTRO_INSTALL_UNLOCK_P5_A(1)	If you need to unlock LOCKBASE for several users, you can make work easier by collecting all needed licence keys and send them to your LOCKBASE service partner by email in one pass. To do so you have to start LOCKBASE once for each user, note the licence key and then abort the licence dialogue. After you have received the unlock keys you can licence all users in a second pass. 

=M_INTRO_INSTALL_LOGIN(0)	Log on to LOCKBASE 

=M_INTRO_INSTALL_LOGIN_P1(0)	Log on to LOCKBASE 

=M_INTRO_INSTALL_LOGIN_P2(0)	If the {user administration}->MAIN_OPTIONS_USERADMIN is active, first you have to log on to LOCKBASE. The login dialogue with the following entry fields appears: 

=M_INTRO_INSTALL_LOGIN_P2_A(0)	f{Username}: Enter your username here. By default the Windows username will be displayed, therefore it is recommended to use your Windows user name also as LOCKBASE user name. 

=M_INTRO_INSTALL_LOGIN_P2_B(0)	f{Password}: Enter your LOCKBASE password here. 

=M_INTRO_INSTALL_LOGIN_P3(0)	The login dialogue for the main administrator 

=M_INTRO_INSTALL_LOGIN_P4(0)	When LOCKBASE is started for the first time, a password for the main administrator has to be entered. The first user starting LOCKBASE automatically will become the main administrator. This user is allowed to access the user administration and create the other users (refer to Chap. III-2, {'User Administration'}->MAIN_OPTIONS_USERADMIN). Later you can revoke administrator priviliges from the main administrator, however, there always must be at least one user with administrator privileges. 

=M_INTRO_INSTALL_LOGIN_P5(0)	The login dialogue for the main administrator has an additional field for password confirmation: 

=M_INTRO_INSTALL_LOGIN_P5_A(0)	f{Retype Password}: Repeat the password for the main administrator here. This field serves to recheck the entry in field f{Password}. By this typing errors during the entry can be avoided. 

=M_INTRO_WIN(0)	3. The Windows User Interface 

=M_INTRO_WIN_P1(0)	PC users who are familiar with the handling of Windows and symbols under Windows can miss out this passage. 

=M_INTRO_WIN_P2(0)	The first you see after Windows has started up is the Windows w{Desktop}. At the bottom left corner of the screen is a button with the title 'Start' and the Windows icon. 

=M_INTRO_WIN_P3(0)	i{START_MENU.BMP} By this button you can open the Windows m{Start} menu. It essentially serves to start the programs which are installed on your PC. Every available program corresponds to an entry in the m{Start} menu or one of its sub menus. The most application programs are located in the sub menu m{Programs}. 

=M_INTRO_WIN_P4(0)	To start LOCKBASE move the mouse cursor to the entry m{Programs}, then to m{LOCKBASE} and click onto m{LOCKBASE} inside this folder. After a short time the LOCKBASE w{main window} appears on the screen. 

=M_INTRO_WIN_WINDOWS(0)	Window Operating 

=M_INTRO_WIN_WINDOWS_P1(0)	Data belonging together (programs and documents) will be displayed in rectangular screen sectors, so called windows, under the graphic user interface Windows. It is possible to show on the screen several windows at the same time. Nevertheless only one window can be active and be in the foreground, because you can work in only one window at any time. The other windows are inactive and "non focused". 

=M_INTRO_WIN_WINDOWS_P2(0)	Scroll Bars 

=M_INTRO_WIN_WINDOWS_P3(0)	If the window is too small to display all the data that is contained e.g. in a list, then at the bottom and at the right side appear so called scroll bars. With their aid you can shift by mouse the window section. Keyboard users therefore take the keys k{Page down}, k{Page up} or the k{Arrow keys}. 

=M_INTRO_WIN_WINDOWS_P4(0)	A window could be enlarged to a full screen picture so that it covers the whole computer screen or it could be diminished to an icon, whereby place for other windows will be free. The icons of already started programs will be displayed at the bottom of the Windows w{Desktop} on the so called Task Bar. 

=M_INTRO_WIN_WINDOWS_P5(0)	With the aid of the buttons at the top right of every window corner, you can enlarge the window to a full screen picture, reduce it to an icon or re-create it in its original position. 

=M_INTRO_WIN_WINDOWS_P5_A(0)	i{BTN_WIN_FULL.BMP} Button f{Full Picture}. The window will fill the entire screen. 

=M_INTRO_WIN_WINDOWS_P5_B(0)	i{BTN_WIN_ICON.BMP} Button f{Icon}. The window will appear as an icon on the bottom edge of the screen. 

=M_INTRO_WIN_WINDOWS_P5_C(0)	i{BTN_WIN_NORM.BMP} Button f{Recreate}. The window will be recreated on its original position. 

=M_INTRO_WIN_WINDOWS_P5_D(0)	i{BTN_WIN_CLOSE.BMP} Button f{Close}, the window will be closed. 

=M_INTRO_WIN_WINDOWS_P6(0)	By dragging the window frame you can alter the window size. By dragging the title bar you can shift the window on the screen. 

=M_INTRO_WIN_WINDOWS_P7(0)	Keyboard users achieve the same possibilities with the aid of the program m{system menu}, which is to be opened with the key combination k{Alt+Space} resp. k{Alt+-} (hyphen) or a mouse click on the system menu field in the top left of every window corner. The LOCKBASE windows w{System Matrix}->MTRX, w{Data Lists}->LST, w{System Designer}->DSGN and w{Calculator}->CALC also have a field like this, which can be opened with k{Alt+-} (Hyphen). 

=M_INTRO_WIN_COMMANDS(0)	Menus, Commands and dialogue Boxes 

=M_INTRO_WIN_COMMANDS_P1(0)	Each program which was designed for the graphic user interface Windows works in a similar way - so does LOCKBASE. 

=M_INTRO_WIN_COMMANDS_P2(0)	All commands to control LOCKBASE, you find in the {main menu} at the upper edge of the window. The commands are arranged in groups, for instance all commands that concern a file as a whole (m{Save}, m{Print},...), could be found in the menu m{File}, whereas in the menu m{Edit} you find commands that concern the file contents (m{Delete}, m{Add}, ...). All LOCKBASE commands will be explained in this manual. 

=M_INTRO_WIN_COMMANDS_P3(0)	Everytime LOCKBASE needs additional information before executing a command, a so called dialogue box appears on the screen to ask for the missing information. The command m{File - Open} e.g. invokes the dialogue box w{File open}, in that you have to type in the name of the master key system file that is to open. 

=M_INTRO_WIN_COMMANDS_P4(0)	You can reach the menus, commands, options and entry fields of the dialogue boxes in several ways: 

=M_INTRO_WIN_COMMANDS_P4_A(0)	by a mouse click on it, 

=M_INTRO_WIN_COMMANDS_P4_B(0)	by a mouse click on the corresponding button in the toolbar (if existing), 

=M_INTRO_WIN_COMMANDS_P4_C(0)	by keyboard, 

=M_INTRO_WIN_COMMANDS_P4_D(0)	with the aid of a hotkey combination (if existing). 

=M_INTRO_WIN_COMMANDS_P5(0)	One letter is underlined in all command names and designations of the entry fields that is together with the k{Alt}-key usable as a hotkey. E.g. with k{Alt+F} you open the menu m{File}. 

=M_INTRO_WIN_COMMANDS_P6(0)	Some of the often required commands you also could execute with a combination of keys, that is displayed - if existing - in the menu. E.g. you execute the command m{File - Open} with the key combination k{Ctrl+F12} (function key k{F12}). In case you use a key combination the menu must not be open. 

=M_INTRO_WIN_COMMANDS_P7(0)	Which method you use selecting a command does not matter. Therefore in the following of this manual the formulation "selecting a command" is used. So it is up to you if you use the keyboard, the mouse or a hotkey. Using the keyboard you are able to work faster but you have to learn a little bit more. 

=M_INTRO_WIN_COMMANDS_P8(0)	All dialogue boxes contain the button f{OK} and f{Cancel}, many also the button f{Help}. With the keyboard you reach them like it is explained in the following: 

=M_INTRO_WIN_COMMANDS_P8_A(0)	f{OK}: k{Enter}, when the button has a bold frame. (Otherwise move the marking with the k{Tab}-key to the f{OK}-button and then press k{Enter}.) The command will be executed with the current adjustments in the dialogue box. 

=M_INTRO_WIN_COMMANDS_P8_B(0)	f{Cancel}: k{Esc}. The command will not be executed, the dialogue box will be closed. 

=M_INTRO_WIN_COMMANDS_P8_C(0)	f{Help}: k{F1}. With this function key you can start whenever you want the LOCKBASE Help program that serves you information and explanations for the current state of your work. To get out of the help program back to LOCKBASE, you could minimize it to an icon or press k{Alt+Tab}. 

=M_INTRO_WIN_COMMANDS_P9(0)	For more information about the handling of Windows please refer to your Windows user manual. 

=M_FSTEP(0)	II. First Steps 

=M_FSTEP_P1(0)	System Matrix 

=M_FSTEP_P2(0)	The LOCKBASE w{System Matrix}->MTRX supports the entry and specification of master key systems. This means that the cylinders and keys of a master key system can be entered, added to, deleted or altered. Furthermore, connections can be determined. 

=M_FSTEP_P3(0)	Calculator 

=M_FSTEP_P4(0)	The LOCKBASE w{Calculator}->CALC calculates master key systems entered with the w{Data Lists}->LST, the w{System Matrix}->MTRX or the w{System Designer}->DSGN in accordance with your pre-settings. 

=M_FSTEP_P5(0)	Data Lists 

=M_FSTEP_P6(0)	The LOCKBASE w{Data Lists}->LST contain lists for the key holders, keys, cylinders and doors. Here data can also be entered, added to, deleted or altered. The w{Data Lists} window is suitable for the administration of master key systems. 

=M_FSTEP_P7(0)	System Designer 

=M_FSTEP_P8(0)	The LOCKBASE w{System Designer}->DSGN is of great help recording a master key system. Furthermore, it supports the planning of large hierarchical master key systems. 

=M_FSTEP_P9(0)	Print Manager 

=M_FSTEP_P10(0)	The LOCKBASE w{Print Manager}->PRN can lay out the documents to print in accordance with your wishes. You can print out all necessary data for the setting up, assembling and administration of master key systems. 

=M_FSTEP_P11(0)	The LOCKBASE Help 

=M_FSTEP_P12(0)	LOCKBASE has a very comfortable help program. You have several possibilities to get "online" information and cues during your work with LOCKBASE. For more information refer to Chap. III-4, {'The LOCKBASE Online-Help'}->MAIN_HELP. 

=M_FSTEP_SETUP(0)	1. Setting up a new Master Key System 

=M_FSTEP_SETUP_P1(0)	The master key system which you should have set up and calculated at the end of this introduction should look as follows: 

=M_FSTEP_SETUP_P1_A(0)	It has a top master key TMK (locks all cylinders in the master key system) as well as two subgroups. 

=M_FSTEP_SETUP_P1_B(0)	Group 1 has a master key MK 1 (locks all cylinders in group 1), 3 cylinders (C1 to C3) as well as 3 interchange keys K1 to K3 (keys which lock more than one cylinder, but not all the cylinders of this group). 

=M_FSTEP_SETUP_P1_C(0)	Group 2 has 3 cylinders (C4 to C6) with individual change keys. 

=M_FSTEP_SETUP_P2(0)	Dialogue box w{System Cover Sheet}

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P7_A(0)	Code group means the way how cutting positions vary. This differs according to the cylinder brands. E.g. GeGe distinguishes between even and odd cutting positions. An 'A' stands for the cutting depths 2, 4, 6, 8, 0, a 'B' for 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. A GeGe code group consist of the letters 'A' and 'B'; should the situation arise side pins etc. and a keyway group can also belong to a code group. 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P7_B(0)	If the brand "GeGe P1-18 5" is not part of your LOCKBASE package choose another brand. You do this by clicking the button with an f{arrow and question mark} on it (context sensitive help). Afterwards click in the field f{Code Group}. Select one of your cylinder brands out of the list. Enter the brand designation and code group in the LOCKBASE w{Calculator}->CALC according to the corresponding example. 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P8(0)	To select a code group from the w{Code Group Administration}->CALC_CGA proceed as follows: 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P8_A(0)	Click on i{BTN_CALC_CGA.BMP} in the toolbar of the w{Calculator} or from the menu choose m{Edit - Code Group Administration}. The dialogue box w{Code Group Administration} appears. 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P8_B(0)	Select "GeGe P1-18 5" from the list and press k{Enter}. 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P8_C(0)	To subdivide the code group double-click the entry "AABBA P1-18" and split up by profiles i.e. keyways. 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P8_D(0)	Double-click "AABBA G1" and split up by f{Constant Pins}. Accept these defaults with f{OK}. 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P8_E(0)	Choose the code group "AABB6 G1" and click on the button f{Occupy}. 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P8_F(0)	Leave w{Code Group Administration} with button f{Close}. 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P9(0)	Dialogue box w{Code Group Administration} 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P10(0)	Establish Keyway, Key Bitting Array and Master Key Codes 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P11(0)	To establish the key bitting array for the entire system, the master key's combination and keyway as well as possibly further keyway(s), 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P11_A(0)	select item m{Edit Key Bitting Array} in the m{Edit} menu. 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P12(0)	The dialogue box w{Edit Key Bitting Array}->CALC_KBA appears. 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P13(0)	Select a Keyway 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P14(0)	To select a keyway proceed the following steps: 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P14_A(0)	Click on the keyway "P3" in the list f{Keyways Keys}. Thus it will be used for the calculation. 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P14_B(0)	Click on the button f{Master Key}. Now the keyway will also be used for the master key. The "+" sign marks it as a master key keyway. 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P14_C(0)	Click on the keyway "P3" in the list f{Keyways Plugs}. 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P15(0)	Note: 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P15_A(0)	If you have to calculate a small master key system with only one keyway, you could restrict the keyway range already by selecting a smaller code group. To do so choose code group "AABB6 P3" instead of "AABB6 G1" (for more information about dividing up of code groups refer to Chap. VII-2, {'Code Group Administration'}->CALC_CGA). 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P16(0)	Establishing the Combination of the Master Key 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P17(0)	In the entry field f{Key Bitting Array} a code group according to each brand appears with all possible cutting depths. The left hand column of figures corresponds to the first pin chamber which is operated by the first cut position of the key (bow stop), the last column of figures corresponds to the last pin chamber of the cylinder which is operated by the last cut of the key (tip). The pins displayed marked designate the master key combination. The "2" in the first pin chamber is already established. We want to leave it as master key position. 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P18(0)	To establish the master key combination: 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P18_A(0)	Click on the "4" in the second column and press the button f{Master Key}. Repeat this for "5" in the fourth column. You now have established the combination for the top master key (24156). 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P19(0)	In addition to this we set the "2" in the first column exclusively for "TMK", meaning it is reserved for the top master key and will not be used in any other key combination of this system. 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P19_A(0)	For that click on the "2" in the first column and press the button f{Exclusive}. The "2" now appears reserved in red. 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P20(0)	Editing the Key Bitting Array 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P21(0)	Now we want to further restrict the key bitting array. 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P21_A(0)	Click on the "8" in the first column and press the k{Del} key twice. The depths "8" and "0" disappear and will not be used in the calculation. Should you have deleted a wrong depth, re-enter the inadvertently deleted number using the corresponding key on the keyboard. 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P21_B(0)	Leave the dialogue box by clicking on f{OK}. 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P22(0)	Dialogue box w{Edit Key Bitting Array} 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P23(0)	Guide: 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P23_A(0)	If you work without the LOCKBASE w{System Designer}->DSGN, you can step over the rest of this section. 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P24(0)	To calculate a master key system with subgroups it must be analysed for a hidden group structure: 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P24_A(0)	Change to the w{System Designer}->DSGN. 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P24_B(0)	Press the button f{Analyse} in the area f{Subgroups}. Two subgroups appear. 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P24_C(0)	Change to the w{Calculator}->CALC again. 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P25(0)	We are going to distinguish the key codes of group 1 from those of group 2 by using the position "4" in the 1st pin chamber exclusively for group 1. It is the group sign indicator of group 1. 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P26(0)	Set up the key bitting array of group 1 as well as combination and keyway for "MK1": 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P26_A(0)	Double-click group 1 that is the rectangle named "1". The dialogue box w{Edit Key Bitting Array} appears. Depth "2" in the first column of the key bitting array is not longer visible because it was set exclusively for "TMK". 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P26_B(0)	Delete the "6" as shown above from the first column. 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P26_C(0)	Leave the dialogue box by clicking on f{OK}. 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P27(0)	Dialogue box w{Edit Key Bitting Array}, group 1 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P28(0)	Set up the key bitting array of group 2: 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P28_A(0)	Double-click on the rectangle named "2" that is group 2. The dialogue box w{Edit Key Bitting Array} appears. 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P28_B(0)	Delete the "4" as shown above from the first column (the "4" is the group sign indicator of group 1). 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P28_C(0)	Leave the dialogue box by clicking on f{OK}. 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P28_D(0)	Before calculation change to the system's top level, click on the oval with the system number on it. 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P29(0)	Dialogue box w{Edit Key Bitting Array}, group 2 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P30(0)	Start Calculation 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P31(0)	LOCKBASE now is ready to calculate the master key system. 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P31_A(0)	Select command m{Calculate} from the menu m{Edit}. 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P32(0)	LOCKBASE notifies you whether it has carried out the calculation. The result of the calculation can be reviewed in the Key Functions List right in the w{Calculator}->CALC. 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P33(0)	Transfer Calculation 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P34(0)	You can now transfer the calculated bittings, keyways and cylinder pinnings to the key function and cylinder data sets. 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P34_A(0)	Select the menu item m{Transfer} in the menu m{Edit}. The dialogue box w{Transfer Calculation} appears. 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P34_B(0)	Click on the button f{Export}. 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P34_C(0)	Click on the button f{OK}. LOCKBASE reports in the display window that the transfer is completed. 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P34_D(0)	Click on f{OK} again in order to leave the dialogue box. 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P35(0)	w{Calculator} module, transfer process, dialogue box w{Transfer Calculation} 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P36(0)	General Information on Calculating with and without a Group Structure 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P37(0)	Once calculated master key systems usually have to be extended after some time. LOCKBASE takes care that the old key combinations are retained as far as possible. 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P38(0)	You also could calculate a system after having dissolved the system's group structure (see above, section w{System Designer}->DSGN) or if no group structure is existing at all. In this case you merely have to establish the combination for the top master key, and save yourself establishing the combination for the group's master keys (if existing). Thus you leave it to LOCKBASE how to separate the hidden groups. 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P39(0)	However, calculating without group structure takes more effort and is more complicated than calculating with a group structure. 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P40(0)	Printouts for Assembly 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P41(0)	LOCKBASE supports the assembly of master key systems with several printouts. 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P42(0)	We will demonstrate the print out with the example of the Key Bitting List: 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P42_A(0)	Choose in the menu m{File} the entry m{Print}. The dialogue box w{What shall be printed out?}->PRN_SELECT appears. 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P42_B(0)	Click in the list f{Forms} on the word w{Key Bitting List}. 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P42_C(0)	Control the print-out clicking on the button f{Preview}. 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P42_D(0)	Quit the preview with f{Close}. 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P42_E(0)	Print the list, clicking on the button f{Print}. 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P42_F(0)	Close the w{print selection dialogue} by clicking on the button f{Close}. 

=M_FSTEP_CALC_P43(0)	In all LOCKBASE printouts you can adjust font, formats of data, styles and sizes, page margins and more to customise the printouts (see Chap. IX-3, {'The Print Formatting Dialogue'}->PRN_FORMAT). 

=M_FSTEP_KEYCTRL(0)	3. Key Control with LOCKBASE 

=M_FSTEP_KEYCTRL_P1(0)	File Persons 

=M_FSTEP_KEYCTRL_P2(0)	You can only file a person if you have LOCKBASE w{Data Lists}->LST at your disposal. Change into the w{Data Lists} by 

=M_FSTEP_KEYCTRL_P2_A(0)	selecting the menu item m{Open Data Lists} in the m{Window} menu. 

=M_FSTEP_KEYCTRL_P2_B(0)	Click on the button above the key holders list on the left (there are four faces on it). 

=M_FSTEP_KEYCTRL_P2_C(0)	Select the menu item m{Add} in the m{Edit} menu. The dialogue box w{Key Holder} opens. 

=M_FSTEP_KEYCTRL_P2_D(0)	Type "Smith" in the entry field f{Surname}. 

=M_FSTEP_KEYCTRL_P2_E(0)	Leave the dialogue box by clicking on f{OK}. 

=M_FSTEP_KEYCTRL_P3(0)	Dialogue box w{Key Holder} 

=M_FSTEP_KEYCTRL_P4(0)	Issue and Return of Keys 

=M_FSTEP_KEYCTRL_P5(0)	Now give out the key "K2-1" to Mrs. "Smith": 

=M_FSTEP_KEYCTRL_P5_A(0)	Select the menu item m{Connect} in the menu m{Edit}. A dialogue box w{Connect Key Holder(s) to Key(s)} appears. 

=M_FSTEP_KEYCTRL_P5_B(0)	The key "K2-1" is already selected in the list f{Not Connected}. 

=M_FSTEP_KEYCTRL_P5_C(0)	Click on the button f{<<} so that the key appears in the list f{Connected}. 

=M_FSTEP_KEYCTRL_P5_D(0)	Activate the check box f{Print receipt directly}. This enables LOCKBASE to print a key return receipt. 

=M_FSTEP_KEYCTRL_P5_E(0)	Leave the dialogue box by clicking on f{OK}. The dialogue box w{Key} appears. 

=M_FSTEP_KEYCTRL_P5_F(0)	Enter the return date for the key here, if applicable. 

=M_FSTEP_KEYCTRL_P5_G(0)	Leave the dialogue box by clicking on f{OK}. 

=M_FSTEP_KEYCTRL_P6(0)	Dialogue box w{Key} 

=M_FSTEP_KEYCTRL_P7(0)	For key return you go the reverse way: With the button f{>>} shift a key from the list f{Connected} into the list f{Not Connected}. 

=M_MAIN(0)	III. The LOCKBASE Main Window 

=M_MAIN_P1(0)	The LOCKBASE w{Main Window}: a) main menu, b) toolbars of the w{Main Window} (above) and w{Data Lists} (bottom), c) the four document windows of LOCKBASE w{Professional}, d) Status bar. 

=M_MAIN_P2(0)	The program window and the general LOCKBASE commands will be explained in the following. 

=M_MAIN_P3(0)	The picture shows the LOCKBASE version w{Professional} with an opened master key system file. Active is the recent one in the foreground of the four document windows w{System Designer}->DSGN, w{System Matrix}->MTRX, w{Calculator}->CALC and w{Data Lists}->LST (c), that display the master key system. All entries and commands currently refer to this window. 

=M_MAIN_P4(0)	Because the four windows offer different possibilities for operating a master key system, the contents of some menus change if another window is activated. You get some more information on it, when all the windows will be explained. 

=M_MAIN_P5(0)	The status bar (d) at the bottom edge of the window shows helpful information about all commands and the buttons of the toolbars. 

=M_MAIN_FILE(0)	1. Handling of Master Key System Files 

=M_MAIN_FILE_P1(0)	All commands that refer to a master key system file as a whole can be found in the menu m{File}. This menu is independent of the circumstance which window is displayed in the foreground. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_NEW(0)	Creating a new Master Key System 

=M_MAIN_FILE_NEW_P1(0)	The command m{File - New} lets you create a new master key system (not in LOCKBASE version w{Manager lite}). 

=M_MAIN_FILE_NEW_P1_A(0)	Click on i{BTN_MAIN_NEW.BMP} in the toolbar or 

=M_MAIN_FILE_NEW_P1_B(0)	select command m{File - New} or 

=M_MAIN_FILE_NEW_P1_C(0)	press key k{F11}. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_NEW_P2(0)	First, the dialogue box w{System Cover Sheet}->MAIN_FILE_COVERSHEET appears. Next as default LOCKBASE opens the windows w{Data Lists}->LST, w{System Matrix}->MTRX, w{System Designer}->DSGN and w{Calculator}->CALC (only in the LOCKBASE w{Professional} and w{Calculator} versions) for data entry. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_NEW_P3(0)	If you have laid down something else with the aid of the command m{Options - Open Windows on Start}->MAIN_OPTIONS_OPENWINONSTART, then only that or respectively the desired window(s) will be opened. The windows are empty and ready for data entry. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN(0)	Opening an existing Master Key System File 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_P1(0)	With this command you open an already existing LOCKBASE file (not in LOCKBASE version w{Manager lite}). Proceed as follows: 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_P1_A(0)	Click on i{BTN_MAIN_OPEN.BMP} in the toolbar or 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_P1_B(0)	select the command m{File - Open} or 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_P1_C(0)	press the key combination k{Ctrl+F12}. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_P2(0)	The dialogue box w{File Open} 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_P3(0)	The dialogue box w{File Open} appears. It contains the following entry fields: 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_P3_A(0)	f{Look in}: Select the drive and the directory from this list, where the master key system file was stored. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_P3_B(0)	f{File Name}: Enter the complete name of the file (with the extension .LBF) you would like to edit; or choose one out of the list below. (The lists you attain by mouse-click or with the k{Tab} key.) 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_P3_C(0)	f{List Files of Type}: If the master key system was entered with LOCKBASE the suitable format is "LOCKBASE file (*.lbf)". If you want to import a master key system generated by a third party program, select the corresponding file type from this list (refer to Chap. III-1, {'Data import from CSV files'}->MAIN_FILE_OPEN_IMPORT_CSV). 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_P3_D(0)	f{Open}: Click this button to open the selected file. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_P3_E(0)	f{Contents}: You can enter text here, which should be searched for in the files of the given directory. This can be useful if you are not sure, under which name you had stored a certain file. All files containing the given text phrase will be found. The case of the letters will be ignored. Entering more than one word will limit the search to those files, which contain all of the words entered. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_P3_F(0)	f{Search}: Click this button to start the search. All LOCKBASE files in the current directory and all its sub directories will be searched for the text entered in f{Contents}. The files found will be displayed in the list f{Search Results}. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_P3_G(0)	f{Password}: Even password protected files can be viewed in the preview window, if you enter the correct password here. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_P3_H(0)	f{Search Results}: Here you will find the files listed, which contain the search text entered in f{Contents}. The first column shows the name of the file, the second the sub directory containing the file. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_P3_I(0)	f{Preview}: This window displays a preview of the cover sheet of the selected file (refer to Chap. III-1, {'System Cover Sheet'}->MAIN_FILE_COVERSHEET). 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_P4(0)	Notes: 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_P4_A(0)	You do have the possibility to search for LOCKBASE files in directories and drives. Simply mark another directory or drive in the corresponding entry fields. After a moment the dialogue box displays a list of the .LBF files which are stored there. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_P4_B(0)	If a password was entered in the w{System Cover Sheet}->MAIN_FILE_COVERSHEET to protect a master key system file from an unauthorised access, the dialogue box w{Password Check}->MAIN_FILE_PWD opens, as soon as you select f{OK}. After you have typed in the right password or if no password is entered, LOCKBASE loads the stated master key system and opens all the windows which were laid down by the command m{Options - Open Window on Start}->MAIN_OPTIONS_OPENWINONSTART. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_P4_C(0)	It is possible to open various master key system files at the same time. Which file is displayed in a certain window is shown in the title bar at the upper edge of the window. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_P5(0)	Windows tip: 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_P5_A(0)	In case you work with the Windows w{Explorer} you can double-click on a .LBF-file (or k{Enter} if it is marked) to start LOCKBASE (if not already started) and to open the selected file. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_IMPORT_CSV(0)	Data import from CSV files 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_IMPORT_CSV_P1(0)	The CSV import filter allows data import from software, which is able to export its data in CSV format ('comma separated values'). These are mainly database systems and spread sheet programs. But also other data stocks, which are available as ASCII files, often can be converted easily to the CSV format. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_IMPORT_CSV_P2(0)	The CSV format is a universal data format to represent tables of any kind. However, if such a table contains master key system data, additionally it has to be defined, which column resp. row contains which kind of data. This information is stored in the CSV format specifications, which can be selected and created using the format selection dialogue. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_IMPORT_CSV_P3(0)	The dialogue box w{Select format specification} 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_IMPORT_CSV_P4(0)	The dialogue w{Select format specification} opens automatically, if the import filter 'CSV (*.csv)' was selected in the dialogue w{Open}(see Chap. III-1, {'Opening an existing Master Key System File'}->MAIN_FILE_OPEN). 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_IMPORT_CSV_P5(0)	The dialogue shows a selection list of the available format specifications and offers the following commands: 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_IMPORT_CSV_P5_A(0)	f{Apply}: Press this button to use the selected format specification for the interpretation of the file to open. The command is only available, if only a single format specification was selected. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_IMPORT_CSV_P5_B(0)	f{Close}: Press this button to leave the dialogue without applying a format specification. The file will not be opened, however, new format specifications or changes to existing ones will be saved. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_IMPORT_CSV_P5_C(0)	f{Add}: Press this button to create a new format specification. The dialogue w{Edit format specification} opens (s.b.). 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_IMPORT_CSV_P5_D(0)	f{Edit}: Press this button to modify the selected format specification. The dialogue w{Edit format specification} opens (s.b.). 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_IMPORT_CSV_P5_E(0)	f{Delete}: Press this button to remove the selected format specifications. A confirmation request prevents from unintended deletion. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_IMPORT_CSV_P5_F(0)	f{Copy}: This command allows to copy the selected format specifications to the clipboard. Thus in a simple way variants of available format specifications can be created. Moreover, it is possible to make available your own format specifications for other LOCKBASE users by exporting them via clipboard. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_IMPORT_CSV_P5_G(0)	f{Paste}: Press this button to paste LOCKBASE format specifications available in the clipboard to the selection list. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_IMPORT_CSV_P6(0)	CSV files are ASCII text files, where each text line represents the row of a table. The single data fields of line are separated by a special character (the so called field separator, usually the comma). If a field should contain the field separator (or even a line feed), the contents of the field can be enclosed in quotation marks. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_IMPORT_CSV_P7(0)	Thus tables of any contents can be represented in text form and the individual cells of the table can be addressed using the notation well known from spread sheet software: A combination of capital letters stands for the column and a following decimal number for the row of a cell (e.g. 'A12' or 'AB7'). 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_IMPORT_CSV_P8(0)	To represent more than one table it is usual to create a file for each table and a new sub directory for the complete file set. The name of the file represents the name of the table, e.g. 'Cylinders.csv', 'Keys.csv', 'Doors.csv', etc. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_IMPORT_CSV_P9(0)	LOCKBASE supports this common format, but additionally offers a possibility to represent multiple tables in a single file. To do so, the name of the table, enclosed in square brackets and in a dedicated line, will be put in front of the related table. This way the change to a new table will be marked by an empty line, directly followed by a line containing only the name of the new table, enclosed in square brackets. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_IMPORT_CSV_P10(0)	A data import from the tables is possible by defining a source area in the table (a column or row) for each LOCKBASE data field fo import (e.g. cylinder number: cell 'A5' to 'A100', key function: cell 'F2' to 'Z2', etc.). 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_IMPORT_CSV_P11(0)	Connections between data stocks can be represented in two different ways: As matrix or as lists of values. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_IMPORT_CSV_P12(0)	The matrix representation is well known from the European lock charts (System Matrix). The connections will be taken from the intersection area of an already defined column and row, e.g. the intersection fields of cylinder numbers, listed in a column, and key functions, listed in a row. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_IMPORT_CSV_P13(0)	Lists of values define connections of records from different data stocks by a list of related pairs of values. It says for example: Connect the cylinder with the number found in cell 'B4' to the key function found in cell 'F4', etc. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_IMPORT_CSV_P14(0)	The dialogue box w{Edit format specification} 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_IMPORT_CSV_P15(0)	The dialoue w{Edit format specification} allows to specify such an CSV import format. The dialogue can be reached by pressing the buttons f{Edit} or f{New} in the dialogue w{Select format specification} (s.a.). The dialogue offers the following entry fields and commands: 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_IMPORT_CSV_P15_A(0)	f{Name}: Enter a name for the new format specification here. The name appears in the list of the format selection dialogue. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_IMPORT_CSV_P15_B(0)	f{Description}: This field can be used for additional explanations concerning the usage of the new format specification. This description appears in the list of the format selection dialogue. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_IMPORT_CSV_P15_C(0)	f{Data fields}: This is the list of data field and link specifications already defined. Select the respective entry in the list to edit the definition of a data field. The data field specification will be displayed in the entry fields on the right and can be modified. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_IMPORT_CSV_P15_D(0)	f{New}: Use this button to create a new data field or link specification. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_IMPORT_CSV_P15_E(0)	f{Delete}: Press this button to remove a data field specification. A confirmation request prevents from unintended deletion. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_IMPORT_CSV_P15_F(0)	f{Type of data source}: Choose here, whether you want to create a definition for a data field or a connection. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_IMPORT_CSV_P15_G(0)	f{Data type}: Select the LOCKBASE data stock here, for which you would like to define a data or link import source. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_IMPORT_CSV_P15_H(0)	f{Data field}: Select the LOCKBASE data field here, for which you would like to define a data or link import source. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_IMPORT_CSV_P15_I(0)	f{Table}: Enter the name of the table here, where the data can be found. In the 'classical' representation the table name is the file name (without extension), in the LOCKBASE specific representation the table name can be found, enclosed in square brackets, in a dedicated line directly followed by the related data. If you import just from a single table, leave this field empty. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_IMPORT_CSV_P15_J(0)	f{Source area}, f{From}, f{To}: Enter the table area to read data from here. Choose, whether it is a column or row, then enter the first and last cell of the area, e.g. 'Column A5 to A100' oder 'Row F3 to Z3'. Please regard, that in a column area the character combination of first and last cell have to be the same, while in a row area the decimal values have to be the same. If you don't know the last cell of the area, but you always want to read until the end of the table, leave the field f{To}empty. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_IMPORT_CSV_P15_K(0)	f{Type of connection}: If you have selected 'Connection' in the field f{Type of data source}, you have to define the type of connection here: 'Matrix' or 'Lists of values' (s.a.). If you choose 'Matrix' you don't have to define data source areas. The source area of the connection (the matrix) will be derived from the two data fields the connection refers to. These data fields are to enter in the fields f{Data type}, f{Data field}, f{Target data type} and f{Target data field}. For both data fields source areas already have to be defined. If you choose 'List of values' you have to define at least a source area for the target data field. A source area for the basic data field of the connection is not required, if you chose '[Position]' in the entry field f{Data field}. In this case the basic record will not be identified by a field value, but by its position (e.g.: Connect the first, second, third cylinder to the door found in cell 'F4,5,6', etc.). If you choose '[Position]' for the target data field also, it will be assumed, that the source area of the target contains position data of the target data type (e.g. '1-10,15' means 'First to tenth and fifteenth'). 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_IMPORT_CSV_P15_L(0)	f{Target data type}: Select the LOCKBASE data stock of the target of the connection here. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_IMPORT_CSV_P15_M(0)	f{Target data field}: Select the LOCKBASE data field of the target of the connection here. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_OPEN_IMPORT_CSV_P15_N(0)	f{Source area}, f{From}, f{To}: Enter the source area of the target of the connection here (s.a.). 

=M_MAIN_FILE_CLOSE(0)	Closing a File 

=M_MAIN_FILE_CLOSE_P1(0)	When you have finished your work with a master key system, you could close the currently open document windows (w{Data Lists}->LST, w{System Matrix}->MTRX, w{System Designer}->DSGN, w{Calculator}->CALC) with the command m{File - Close} belonging to the currently active master key system. Other master key systems possibly opened and the LOCKBASE program window remains opened however. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_CLOSE_P2(0)	If the system was newly set up or edited and not yet stored, a security query appears to save you from data loss. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_SAVE(0)	Saving a Master Key System File 

=M_MAIN_FILE_SAVE_P1(0)	The command m{File - Save} serves to permanently store alterations in the currently opened file. The new, edited version will be written over the old, unedited file on the disk.

=M_MAIN_FILE_SAVEAS_P1(0)	The command m{File - Save as} (not in LOCKBASE version w{Manager lite}) serves to 

=M_MAIN_FILE_SAVEAS_P1_A(0)	name a newly created master key system on the first storing or to 

=M_MAIN_FILE_SAVEAS_P1_B(0)	store an edited master key system under a new file name, so that the old, unedited version will !{not} be written over. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_SAVEAS_P2(0)	To save a system file under a new name proceed as follows: 

=M_MAIN_FILE_SAVEAS_P2_A(0)	Select the command m{File - Save as} or 

=M_MAIN_FILE_SAVEAS_P2_B(0)	press the key k{F12}. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_SAVEAS_P3(0)	The dialogue box w{File Save as} appears. It offers the following entry fields: 

=M_MAIN_FILE_SAVEAS_P3_A(0)	f{Save in}: Select the drive and directory from this list, where the master key system file should be stored. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_SAVEAS_P3_B(0)	f{File Name}: Here you name the master key system file. The system number from the w{System Cover Sheet} dialogue box is proposed as file name. If you accept this number, the master key system files will be sorted automatically in chronological order. But you can also enter a file name yourself plus the name extension .LBF. Please, assign the name extension .LBF, otherwise LOCKBASE does not recognise that it is a LOCKBASE file when opening it! If an existing name from the list is chosen, the master key system stored hitherto under this name is written over! 

=M_MAIN_FILE_SAVEAS_P3_C(0)	f{List Files of Type}: Usually here you choose "LOCKBASE file (*.lbf)". This is the fitting file type for LOCKBASE master key system files. However if you want to save the file as format template, select the file type "LOCKBASE template (*.lbt)" here. Be sure to save the template in the LOCKBASE directory, so that it can be recognized by LOCKBASE and can be offered in the w{System Cover Sheet} (see Chap. III-1, {'System Cover Sheet'}->MAIN_FILE_COVERSHEET). 

=M_MAIN_FILE_SAVEAS_P4(0)	As soon as you select f{Save}, LOCKBASE stores the master key system and names the file in the way it is entered in the field f{File Name}. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_B2B(0)	Send/Receive Files 

=M_MAIN_FILE_B2B_P1(0)	This command opens a sub menu, which allows access to the functions of the LOCKBASE B2B module. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_B2B_P2(0)	LOCKBASE B2B (for 'business to business') is a module for comfortable an secure interchange of master key system files via internet. The B2B module takes care for addressing, compression, encryption and transmission of the data to transfer. By using the 'public key' encryption method 'RSA' the currently highest possible security standard of data encryption is guaranteed. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_B2B_P3(0)	The dialogue box to send a file 

=M_MAIN_FILE_B2B_P4(0)	To send the current open file by the B2B module

=M_MAIN_FILE_B2B_P5(0)	The dialogue box w{LOCKBASE B2B - Send File} appears. The dialogue offers the following entry fields and control elements: 

=M_MAIN_FILE_B2B_P5_A(0)	f{Recipient}: Select the recipient of the file to send from this list. If only one recipient is possible the list is deactivated and the correct recipient is already selected.

=M_MAIN_FILE_B2B_P5_MODE(0)	f{Mode}: This choice field allows to override the send mode. The send mode defines, how to handle the sent file on the sender's computer (backup and remove or set 'read-only', etc.). By default the send mode will be derived from the file's state. A client usually will send in 'Original as Order' mode, while the manufacturer sends in 'Original as Reply' mode. However, if the manufacturer wants to forward the order iternally, it will not send in 'Original as Reply', but in 'Original as Order' mode, because in this case one department at the manufacturer acts as client of another department, etc. The following send modes are available: 'Copy' keeps the original at the sender's site and doesn't change its state at all. 'Original as Order' sets the file 'read-only' (makes it a copy) and reactivates it when the original file returned. 'Original as Reply' and 'Original as Transfer' will backup and remove the file from the sender's computer.

=M_MAIN_FILE_B2B_P5_B(0)	f{Subject}: Enter the subject of your transmission here. You can enter any text. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_B2B_P5_C(0)	f{Letter}: You can enter a covering letter for the transmission here. You can enter any text. The line doesn't break automatically. To enter a line feed, press the k{Enter} key. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_B2B_P5_D(0)	f{Template}: Press this key, if yo want to save the text entered in f{Letter} as a template. Then, from now on the text will be the default letter when opening the dialogue box, which has only to be adapted to the respective concern.

=M_MAIN_FILE_B2B_P11_F(0)	f{File}: The original name of the file tansmitted. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_B2B_P11_G(0)	f{Extract}: By this button you unpack the selected transmission, i.e. you extract the file attached and store it on your computer. Without unpacking the transmission this way, you can't open the received file. A dialogue box to save the file opens, unless it is the send back of an own file. In this case your copy of the file will be replaced again by the original without any further confirmation. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_B2B_P12(0)	The dialogue box to create a visit card 

=M_MAIN_FILE_B2B_P13(0)	When you start the B2B module for the first time, you have to create your 'B2B visit card'. This way you receive an address, which is unique in the B2B network, and a cryptographic key is created for you. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_B2B_P14(0)	Fill in the fields, then press the button f{Next}. Now you have to help to generate a sequence of 'real' random numbers, which is necessary to create the cryptographic key. After you pressed f{Next} again, LOCKBASE is ready to create your visit card. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_B2B_P15(0)	Notes: 

=M_MAIN_FILE_B2B_P15_A(0)	If you have no file open, the command m{Send current File...} is not available. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_B2B_P15_B(0)	If you send a file as order a write protected copy of this file is kept on your computer. You can still read the file, however, the write protection saves you from modifying the file, while it is edited by the recipient at the same time. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_B2B_P15_C(0)	If you get back the original file, it will be saved under the old name automatically, as a result of which your copy will be replaced by the original again. That's why you don't have to enter a file name during extraction of the file. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_B2B_P15_D(0)	Your B2B visit card is stored in the file 'LbwB2B.vc' in the LOCKBASE program folder. You have to take care for this file, because you cannot open any mail addressed to you without it. If you ever need to reinstall LOCKBASE on another computer, you have to make sure to move this file to the new computer. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_B2B_P16(0)	Security note: 

=M_MAIN_FILE_B2B_P16_A(0)	It is important that no unauthorized person gains access to the file 'LbwB2B' in your LOCKBASE folder. This file contains the private part of your cryptographic key. If an unauthorized person gains access to this file, he/she is possibly able to read and modify B2B transmissions addressed to you.

=M_MAIN_FILE_PWD_P2(0)	With the dialogue box w{Enter Password} you can define a password that is requested to open the file. You can also alter an existing password. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_PWD_P3(0)	The dialogue box offers the following entry fields: 

=M_MAIN_FILE_PWD_P3_A(0)	f{Old Password}: This field is not available at the first password entry. If a password is already entered, you have to enter the password before you can set a new one. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_PWD_P3_B(0)	f{New Password}: Enter the new password here. If you do not enter a password the system file is unprotected. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_PWD_P3_C(0)	f{Retype Password}: If you have entered a new password, you have to repeat it here. If both entries are not identical you get an error message. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_PWD_P4(0)	Security Note: 

=M_MAIN_FILE_PWD_P4_A(0)	For security reasons the password's characters appear as little asterisks (*) on the screen. Be sure that nobody can follow your strokes on the keyboard. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_MACHINE(0)	Machine Interface 

=M_MAIN_FILE_MACHINE_P1(0)	The dialogue box w{Machine Interface} 

=M_MAIN_FILE_MACHINE_P2(0)	If you selected the command m{File - Machine-Interface} the dialogue box w{Machine Interface} opens. Here you can create a file containing key bitting or cylinder pinning information of a certain master key system for transfer to a computer controlled key cutting or automatic pinning machine. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_MACHINE_P3(0)	The dialogue box contains the following entry fields: 

=M_MAIN_FILE_MACHINE_P3_A(0)	f{Machine Type}: Select the type of machine to use. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_MACHINE_P3_B(0)	f{Output File}: The data will be written to the entered file. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_MACHINE_P3_C(0)	f{Output Range}: Here you specify a selection of data sets to be displayed in the f{Keys/Cylinders} list. You can select keys set up at a certain date or all keys/cylinders of the master key system. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_MACHINE_P3_D(0)	f{Keys/Cylinders}: This list contains all keys or cylinders of the output range. You can select some or all of the keys to be cut. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_MACHINE_P3_E(0)	f{Select File}: This button opens the dialogue box w{Export Data to}. Data will be exported to the file you specify here. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_MACHINE_P3_F(0)	f{Line Form}: This button opens the dialogue box w{Edit Line Form Key Copies}->DLG_USAGE_LINE. You can alter the layout of the list f{Keys/Cylinders}. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_MACHINE_P3_G(0)	f{Setup}: This button is available if the key cutter needs additional information. It opens the dialogue box w{Key Cutter Setup}. If - e.g. - the output should be directed to the SILCA Unocode, you have to assign a certain card number to every brand that you use. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_MACHINE_P4(0)	Note: 

=M_MAIN_FILE_MACHINE_P4_A(1)	In the setup dialogue of the machine 'Silca SSI (*.dat)' (Silca Software Interface) besides the card number you can optionally define the related 'cuts included' line (line 4 in the header of the SSI file). This may be necessary if the chosen SILCA card does not support all bitting axes of the brand or expects them in a different order. The 'cuts included' line must be entered in the field 'Extra Parameter' of the Edit dialogue box. The 'cuts included' line is a comma separated listing of the available depths for each axis, preceeded by '#' character, e.g. '#Y,X,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9'. To find out the correct 'cuts included' line for a given card number you have to contact SILCA.

=M_MAIN_FILE_MACHINE_P4_B(0)	You can also use the Silca SSI interface if the system was not calculated by LOCKBASE. In this case you must insert the correct 'cuts included' line and you must define the number of pins of each axis with it. The number of pins must directly follow the axis separators ('#') and it must be separated from the listing of depths by a colon (':'), e.g. '#6:Y,X,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9'.

=M_MAIN_FILE_MGL(0)	Create Manager lite 

=M_MAIN_FILE_MGL_P1(0)	The dialogue box w{Create LOCKBASE Manager lite} 

=M_MAIN_FILE_MGL_P2(0)	This dialogue box enables suppliers of master key systems to create a LOCKBASE w{Manager lite} or a LOCKBASE w{Matrix Viewer}. The w{Manager lite} is a small program to administer a single master key system. The customer usually gains it together with a master key system from his supplier. The w{Matrix Viewer} is a program to review a lock chart. It usually supports the communication between suppliers of master key systems and their clients during the ordering phase of a master key system. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_MGL_P3(0)	With the LOCKBASE w{Manager lite} and w{Matrix Viewer} no changes to technical data is possible. E.g. no key functions and cylinders can be added. Technical information (cylinder pinnings, key combinations, etc.) is not visible. Those changes can only be done with the supplier's LOCKBASE version. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_MGL_P4(0)	The LOCKBASE w{Manager lite} includes only the w{Data Lists}->LST, the LOCKBASE w{Matrix Viewer} only the w{System Matrix}->MTRX. Everything can be printed out except the technical print documents (e.g. key cutting list). Both programs work only with the single system file they were created for. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_MGL_P5(0)	The LOCKBASE w{Manager lite} is no "public domain" software. The supplier can acquire a licence from his LOCKBASE supplier. As a licence he gets a licence code which enables him to create a LOCKBASE w{Manager lite} installation file. However, without a licence code a w{Manager lite} demo can be created. The demo allows the customer to view and print the master key systems data. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_MGL_P6(0)	To create a w{Manager lite} installation file proceed as follows: 

=M_MAIN_FILE_MGL_P6_A(0)	Select command m{File - Create Manager lite}. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_MGL_P7(0)	The dialogue box w{Create LOCKBASE Manager lite} opens. It offers the following entry fields: 

=M_MAIN_FILE_MGL_P7_A(0)	f{System Number}, f{Owner}, f{Customers No.}: These entry fields correspond to the dialogue box w{System Cover Sheet}->MAIN_FILE_COVERSHEET. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_MGL_P7_B(0)	f{Program Type}: Choose the program type here, either 'Manager lite' or 'Matrix Viewer'. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_MGL_P7_C(0)	f{Serial Number}: This entry field contains the unique serial number of the LOCKBASE w{Manager lite} version. It cannot be edited. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_MGL_P7_D(0)	f{Licence Number}: Enter your licence code here (see below). If no licence code was entered, LOCKBASE creates a w{Manager lite} demo diskette. The field is disabled if the system is already licensed. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_MGL_P8(0)	Follow the steps below to successfully create a LOCKBASE w{Manager lite} installation file: 

=M_MAIN_FILE_MGL_P8_A(0)	Create a LOCKBASE system file and complete the data entry, specification and calculation of the system. Take care that in the w{System Cover Sheet} all customer entry fields contain valid data. It cannot be altered later on. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_MGL_P8_B(0)	With your customer's file open call the dialogue box w{Create LOCKBASE Manager lite} by the command m{File - Create Manager lite}. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_MGL_P8_C(0)	If you don't want to create a demo or Matrix Viewer only, call your LOCKBASE supplier for the licence code. Your LOCKBASE supplier will ask you for the contents of the field f{Serial Number} (see above). Enter the licence code into the entry field f{Licence Number}. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_MGL_P8_D(0)	Press the button f{OK}. If all entries are correct, LOCKBASE creates the LOCKBASE w{Manager lite} installation file on your desktop. Otherwise you get corresponding messages. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_MGL_P9(0)	Notes: 

=M_MAIN_FILE_MGL_P9_A(0)	Take care that in the w{System Cover Sheet} all customer entry fields contain valid data. It cannot be altered later on. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_MGL_P9_B(0)	You can easily create a free demonstration file for your customers. To do so proceed the steps to create a w{Manager lite} file but leave the field f{Licence Number} empty. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_MGL_P9_C(0)	A master key system has to be unlocked only once for the w{Manager lite}. Afterwards changes and expansions of the system can be carried out and transferred to the customer without any more licensing. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_C2B(0)	Export Ordering Software (C2B) 

=M_MAIN_FILE_C2B_P1(0)	LOCKBASE C2B is an ordering system for master key systems, which was designed to make data exchange between customer and locksmith resp. lock factory easier and more secure. It consists of three components: 

=M_MAIN_FILE_C2B_P1_A(0)	A tiny ordering program, the LOCKBASE Create Assistant (LbwC2B), which will be used by the customer and allows him to create a master key system in a quick and easy way without having to know much about master key systems; 

=M_MAIN_FILE_C2B_P1_B(0)	an internet service (C2B-Web-Service), which processes and secures data exchange between customer and locksmith/factory; 

=M_MAIN_FILE_C2B_P1_C(0)	a reception module (C2B module) as part of the LOCKBASE installation of the locksmith/factory, which allows LOCKBASE to receive master key systems ordered via C2B. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_C2B_P2(0)	LOCKBASE C2B uses high secure 'public key' encryption (RSA) to secure the data transfer as well as a transparent addressing method ('B2B visit cards') to make data exchange easier and to increase reliability. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_C2B_P3(0)	To create the first component, the ordering software for the customer, 

=M_MAIN_FILE_C2B_P3_A(0)	choose the command m{File - Export Ordering Softwarte (C2B)} 

=M_MAIN_FILE_C2B_P4(0)	The dialogue box w{Save As} opens, which allows to select a storage location for the ordering program 'LbwC2B.exe'. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_C2B_P5(0)	The file 'LbwC2B.exe' contains all necessary components and can be directly executed by the customer without previous installation. The file can be sent by email to the customer or can be offered for download on the locksmith's/factory's web site. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_C2B_P6(0)	During export the program 'LbwC2B.exe' will be customized for your LOCKBASE installation. It contains your B2B visit card (see Chap. III-1, {'Send/Receive Files'}->MAIN_FILE_B2B) and optionally a format template (see Chap. III-1, {'System Cover Sheet'}->MAIN_FILE_COVERSHEET) adjusted by yourself, which should be stored under the name 'LbwC2B.lbt' in your LOCKBASE directory. For this reason you should create a new 'LbwC2B.exe' whenever you modified the format template, installed a LOCKBASE update or created a new B2B visit card for yourself. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_RECENTFILES(0)	Last recently used Files 

=M_MAIN_FILE_RECENTFILES_P1(0)	The list of the last recently used files 

=M_MAIN_FILE_RECENTFILES_P2(0)	In the lower half the menu m{File} contains, numbered, the names of the most recently used files. If you wish to continue working on one of these systems, you merely have to choose one of the file names to open. The underlined cipher is a hotkey. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_EXIT(0)	Ending LOCKBASE 

=M_MAIN_FILE_EXIT_P1(0)	With this command you end a LOCKBASE session: 

=M_MAIN_FILE_EXIT_P1_A(0)	Double-click on the system menu field i{ICON_LBW_SMALL.BMP} in the top left corner or 

=M_MAIN_FILE_EXIT_P1_B(0)	select the command m{File - Exit LOCKBASE} or 

=M_MAIN_FILE_EXIT_P1_C(0)	press k{Alt+F4}. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_EXIT_P2(0)	The w{Main Window} and the currently opened master key systems will be closed. If one of them was newly set up or altered since the last saving, you will receive a security query which protects you against data loss. 

=M_MAIN_FILE_EXIT_P3(0)	Security Note: 

=M_MAIN_FILE_EXIT_P3_A(0)	Never switch off your PC before all programs have ended, otherwise serious data damage on your hard disk could result. 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS(0)	2. Adjustments

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_P1(0)	With the aid of the commands from the menu m{Options} you can adjust the LOCKBASE screen and the LOCKBASE work surrounding. The options which can be toggled, are marked in the menu with a hook i{MENU_CHECK.BMP} if they are switched on. 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_TOOLBAR(0)	Switching Toolbars on and off 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_TOOLBAR_P1_A(0)	Select the command m{Options - Toolbar} to switch the LOCKBASE toolbars on and off. 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_TOOLBAR_P2(0)	Toolbars allow easier access by mouse to many commands.

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_TOOLBAR_P3(0)	The toolbars of: 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_TOOLBAR_P3_A(0)	i{TOOLBAR_MAIN.BMP} w{Main Window}, 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_TOOLBAR_P3_B(0)	i{TOOLBAR_LST.BMP} w{Data Lists}, 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_TOOLBAR_P3_C(0)	i{TOOLBAR_MTRX.BMP} w{System Matrix} and 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_TOOLBAR_P3_D(0)	i{TOOLBAR_CALC.BMP} w{Calculator}. 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_TOOLBAR_P4(0)	The little buttons serve mouse users to have commands carried out faster. If you wish to know which command is behind a certain symbol, point to it with the mouse. After some seconds an explanation appears. 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_STATUSBAR(0)	Switching the Status Bar on and off 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_STATUSBAR_P1_A(0)	Select the command m{Options - Status Bar} to switch on the status line at the bottom edge of the window and off. 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_STATUSBAR_P2(0)	The status bar at the bottom of the LOCKBASE window shows useful information and short explanations when you mark a command in the menu. 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_STATUSBAR_P3(0)	Status bar 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_STATUSBAR_P4(0)	The meaning of the toolbar buttons will also be displayed in the status bar if you point to it with the mouse cursor. 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_STATUSBAR_P5(0)	During creation of data sets and other time consuming operations information about the status of the operation is displayed there. 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_STATUSBAR_P6(0)	At the right side of the status bar is displayed if the k{Numlock}, k{Scroll} and/or k{Cap} key is pressed. 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_OPENLASTFILE(0)	Open Recently Used File 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_OPENLASTFILE_P1(0)	The command m{Options - Open Last Recently Used File} (not in version LOCKBASE w{Manager lite}) tells LOCKBASE to automatically open the system you last edited on startup. 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_OPENWINONSTART(0)	Automatically Opening of LOCKBASE Windows 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_OPENWINONSTART_P1(0)	The dialogue box w{Open Windows on Start} 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_OPENWINONSTART_P2(0)	With the command m{Options - Open Window on Start} (not in version LOCKBASE w{Manager lite}) you decide which of the four windows (w{Data Lists}->LST, w{System Matrix}->MTRX, w{System Designer}->DSGN, and w{Calculator}->CALC - w{Calculator} only in the LOCKBASE w{Professional} and w{Calculator} versions) LOCKBASE should display on starting a new master key system or opening an existing one. 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_OPENWINONSTART_P2_A(0)	Mark the window you want to open automatically with a mouse-click or with the k{Spacebar}. Deselect them in the same way. 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_OPENWINONSTART_P3(0)	Note: 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_OPENWINONSTART_P3_A(0)	This adjustment is stored automatically. 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_USERADMIN(0)	User Administration 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_USERADMIN_P1(0)	The user administration allows the registration of an unlimited number of LOCKBASE users with different access and modification rights to the data of a master key system. By this the number of error sources can be minimized in the workflow of companies, where multiple persons with different tasks need access to a master key system. 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_USERADMIN_P2(0)	To open the user administration, 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_USERADMIN_P2_A(0)	choose the command m{Options - User Administration}. 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_USERADMIN_P3(0)	The dialogue to change the password 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_USERADMIN_P4(0)	The user administration can only be opened by an administrator (s.b.). If a normal user selects this command, a dialogue appears, which can be used by a regular user to change his/her login password. 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_USERADMIN_P5(0)	This dialogue contains the following entry fields: 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_USERADMIN_P5_A(0)	f{Username}: The username of the current user. The contents of this field cannot be modified. 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_USERADMIN_P5_B(0)	f{Old Password}: Enter your old LOCKBASE password here. 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_USERADMIN_P5_C(0)	f{New Password}, f{Retype Password}: Enter your new LOCKBASE passwort in these two fieds. The second field serves to recheck the entry in the first field. By this typing errors during the entry of the password can be avoided. 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_USERADMIN_P6(0)	The LOCKBASE user administration 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_USERADMIN_P7(0)	The administration of the user rights is reserved for the administrators. Only they have access to the user administration. This is the reason, why always at least one administrator has to exist. Therefore LOCKBASE automatically creates an administrator during the first initialisation of the user administration (refer to Chap. I-2, {'Log on to LOCKBASE'}->INTRO_INSTALL_LOGIN). 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_USERADMIN_P8(0)	When an administrator selects the command m{Options - User Administration} the complete user administration appears. The dialogue offers the following entry fields and control elements: 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_USERADMIN_P8_A(0)	f{User List}: The list of all users registered for the use of LOCKBASE, displaying the username. Select the user here, whose properties should be modified. 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_USERADMIN_P8_B(0)	f{New}: Use this button to create a new user. The command saves the changes of the current user and afterwards creates a new user with empty property fields. Enter the new username, password and rights in the respective fields. 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_USERADMIN_P8_C(0)	f{Remove}: This button removes the currently selected user. You can remove all users, except yourself. 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_USERADMIN_P8_D(0)	f{Username}: The username of the user, like appearing during the login (refer to Chap. I-2, {'Log on to LOCKBASE'}->INTRO_INSTALL_LOGIN) and in the list f{User List}. The username is obligatory, must not contain blank characters and must be unique, i.e. every username can only be used once. It is recommended to use the Windows username also for LOCKBASE, because it is the default suggestion for the username during {login}->INTRO_INSTALL_LOGIN. 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_USERADMIN_P8_E(0)	f{Password}, f{Retype Password}: Enter the password of the user in both fields. The second field serves to recheck the entry in the first field. This avoids typing errors when entering the password. 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_USERADMIN_P8_F(0)	f{Administrator}: Activate this check box if the current user should have administrator privileges. An administrator always has all available rights and additionally is allowed to register new users and to modify or remove existing ones. Therefore you should be careful granting the administrator privilege. However, there must be at least one administrator. Therefore LOCKBASE automatically creates an administrator during the first initialisation of the user administration (refer to Chap. I-2, {'Log on to LOCKBASE'}->INTRO_INSTALL_LOGIN). 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_USERADMIN_P8_G(0)	f{Accept Windows Login}: Activate this checkbox if an explicit login should not take place, but the user should be logged on to LOCKBASE automatically by his/her Windows username. The registered password will be ignored in this case. Users which should be logged on automatically, have to be registered in the LOCKBASE users administration with their Windows username. Otherwise a regular login will be run (refer to Chap. I-2, {'Log on to LOCKBASE'}->INTRO_INSTALL_LOGIN). 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_USERADMIN_P8_H(0)	f{Rights}: The user rights are separated into different sections, which are displayed in this list. Activate one of these sections to display the respective rights right beside the list. For a detailed description of the available rights and their meaning, see below. 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_USERADMIN_P8_I(0)	f{Close}: This button ends the user administration. The changes are saved and the dialogue window will be closed. 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_USERADMIN_P8_J(1)	f{Disable}: This button deactivates the user administration. If the user administration is deactivated, every person with access to the computer can use LOCKBASE without any limitations. This can be useful, if LOCKBASE is used only by one person and access to the program is not possible for unauthorized persons. Already registered users will be removed at the next startup of LOCKBASE. The user administration can be reactivated anytime by running again the command m{Options - User Administration}. 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_USERADMIN_P9(0)	To allow easier access and better overview, the LOCKBASE user rights are separated into several different sections. However, it depends on your LOCKBASE configuration, whether a certain right is available or not. For example, if your LOCKBASE has no w{Calculation Module}->CALC, the right f{Calculator} will not appear. The following is a detailed description of every user right and its meaning. 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_USERADMIN_P10(0)	Section !{Views} contains the access rights to the different LOCKBASE views: 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_USERADMIN_P10_A(0)	f{Data Lists}: The user is allowed to use the w{Data Lists} (refer to Chap. V, {'The Data Lists'}->LST). 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_USERADMIN_P10_B(0)	f{System Matrix}: The user is allowed to use the w{System Matrix} (refer to Chap. VI, {'The System Matrix'}->MTRX). 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_USERADMIN_P10_C(0)	f{Calculator}: The user is allowed to use the w{Calculator} (refer to Chap. VII, {'The Calculator'}->CALC). 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_USERADMIN_P10_D(0)	f{System Designer}: The user is allowed to use the w{System Designer} (refer to Chap. VIII, {'The System Designer'}->DSGN). 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_USERADMIN_P11(0)	Section !{Data Access} contains data access limitation rights: 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_USERADMIN_P11_A(0)	f{Technical Data}: The user is allowed to view and modify technical data, like key bittings, cylinder pinnings, or profiles. 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_USERADMIN_P11_B(0)	f{Modify calculated systems}: If this right is granted, the user is allowed to modify and delete data sets in the existing part of a system (already calculated) as well as to add new data sets and connections. If the right is revoked, the user can only make extensions to existing systems. He/she is allowed to work in the new part of the system (not calculated), but is not allowed to modify old cylinders, key functions nor connections among them. However, he/she is allowed to create and remove connections between old and new data sets. 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_USERADMIN_P12(0)	Section !{Extras} covers rights concerning additional features or access to add-on modules: 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_USERADMIN_P12_A(0)	f{Machine Interface}: The user is allowed to operate the w{Machine Interface} (refer to Chap. III-1, {'Machine Interface'}->MAIN_FILE_MACHINE). 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_USERADMIN_P12_B(0)	f{Internet Data Exchange (B2B)}: The user is allowed to exchange data via internet. 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_USERADMIN_P12_C(0)	f{Load and install updates}: The user is allowed to load and install LOCKBASE updates from the internet (refer to chap III-4, {'Information on LOCKBASE'}->MAIN_HELP_ABOUT).

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_USERADMIN_P12_D(0)	f{Allow offline licencing}: The user is allowed to request offline licences (refer to chap III-2, {'Licence Administration'}->MAIN_OPTIONS_LICADMIN). 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_USERADMIN_P13(0)	Notes: 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_USERADMIN_P13_A(0)	If the selected user is an administrator, the control elements in the area f{Rights} are disabled. If you want to modify the rights of a user, first you have to revoke the administrator right by deactivating the check box f{Administrator}. 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_USERADMIN_P13_B(0)	If you receive error messages while changing the current user or closing or deactivating the user administration, the data entered for the current selected user is incomplete or incorrect. Enter the missing values and correct the mistakes, then try again. If you have created a new user by mistake, which should not be taken over into the user administration, simply delete him/her using the button f{Remove}. 

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_USERADMIN_P13_C(0)	If the user administration was disabled, it can be reactivated by running again the command m{Options - User Administration}. Afterwards you have to end and restart LOCKBASE to let the change take effect.

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_LICADMIN(0) Licence Adminstration

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_LICADMIN_P1(0) The licence administration enables you to manage your LOCKBASE licences. It gives you an overview over the current usage of your licences and allows to manage licence mode and the handling of licence related user and computer data.

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_LICADMIN_P2(0) To use the LOCKBASE licence adminstration your computer must have internet access.

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_LICADMIN_P3(0) The most recommended kind of licence usage is the so called '!{session licence}'. The program will request a licence from the LOCKBASE licence server at startup and will release the licence at termination. The released licence can be used by another user immediately. Thus the pool of available licences can be used most efficient.

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_LICADMIN_P4(0) In case internet access is not possible from time to time, e.g. when travelling with a mobile computer, you can request a so called '!{offline licence}'. An offline licence will remain reserved for you until the defined expiration date was reached. During this time the licence can neither be used by another computer, user nor installation. Moreover, its duration cannot be reduced later. For this reason the duration of an offline licence should be chosen as short as possible.

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_LICADMIN_P5(0) To open the licence adminstration,

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_LICADMIN_P5_A(0) select the command m{Options - Licence Adminstration}.

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_LICADMIN_P5a(0) In the top left of the dialogue box you will find a summary of you licence status with licence number, the total number of available licences, the number of licences currently in use, the number of free licences and the internet connection state.

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_LICADMIN_P6(0) The 'Usage' area of the dialogue box w{Licence Administration}

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_LICADMIN_P7(0) The area 'Usage' gives you an overview over the current usage of you licences. It contains the following data fields:

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_LICADMIN_P7_A(0) f{(Usage list)}: This list shows the licences currently in use with information about user and computer and, in case of an offline licence, about the expiration time of the licence. The information about user and computer may be disabled due to privacy settings (s.b.), in this case the column 'Usage' may be empty.

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_LICADMIN_P7_B(0) f{Refresh}: By this button you request again the list of licence usage from the licence server (refresh the display).

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_LICADMIN_P8(0) The area 'Offline licence' area of the dialogue box w{Licence Administration}

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_LICADMIN_P9(0) In the area 'Offline licence' you can request an offline licence or modify the properties of an existing offline licence. The area contains the following data fields:

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_LICADMIN_P9_A(0) f{Desired expiration date}: Select the duration of you offline licence here. The maximum duration is 30 days. Warning: Once it has been issued, the duration of an offline licence cannot be reduced!

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_LICADMIN_P9_B(0) f{Prolong licence automatically in case internet is available}: If you activate this option, after half of its duration your offline licence will be prolonged in a way, that the original duration will be restored. Given you have an offline licence with a duration of 4 days, after 2 days, if internet access is possible, the duration of your licence will be extended by another 2 days.

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_LICADMIN_P9_C(0) f{Apply...}: By clicking this button you launch the request for an offline licence with the defined properties or you modify the properties of an existing offline licence.

=M_MAIN_OPTIONS_LICADMIN_P10(0) The area 'Privacy' of the dialogue box w{Licence Administration}

=M_DLG_USAGE_MOVE_P2(0)	However, you can move the position of one or several data sets. To move a selection of data sets follow the instructions below: 

=M_DLG_USAGE_MOVE_P2_A(0)	Mark the one or the set of records you want to move. 

=M_DLG_USAGE_MOVE_P2_B(0)	Click with the mouse onto the selection and keep the mouse button pressed. 

=M_DLG_USAGE_MOVE_P2_C(0)	Drag the mouse to the position in the list, where the selected data sets should be inserted. The mouse cursor changes its appearance (i{MOUSE_PTR_MVERT.BMP} resp. i{MOUSE_PTR_MHORZ.BMP}). 

=M_DLG_USAGE_MOVE_P2_D(0)	Let the mouse key go. A security request appears. Confirm the movement of the selected data sets or cancel the operation. 

=M_DLG_USAGE_MOVE_P3(0)	Notes: 

=M_DLG_USAGE_MOVE_P3_A(0)	It is necessary to have a mouse installed to move data sets in the LOCKBASE lists. It is not possible to move data sets only using the keyboard. 

=M_DLG_USAGE_MOVE_P3_B(0)	Moving data sets is only possible in the unsorted order of sequence. Choose the command m{Options - Line Form} in the w{Data Lists}->LST or m{Options - Format Lines} resp. m{Options - Format Columns} in the w{System Matrix}->MTRX to be sure, that no data field determines the sort order of the items in the list. 

=M_DLG_USAGE_SORT(0)	Sorting the unsorted display mode 

=M_DLG_USAGE_SORT_P1(1)	The dialogue box w{Sort} 

=M_DLG_USAGE_SORT_P2(0)	Besides sorting by settings in the dialogue w{Edit Line Form} (see. Chap. IV-2, {'Line Formatting and Sorting'}->DLG_USAGE_LINE) it is also possible to sort the unsorted display mode. However, in difference to the sorting by data field, this sorting cannot be undone, but modifies the unsorted order permanently. You can sort all records of a data stock or limit the sorting to a selection of data sets. 

=M_DLG_USAGE_SORT_P3(0)	To open the dialogue box, change to the w{Lists View}->LST or the w{System Matrix}->MTRX and 

=M_DLG_USAGE_SORT_P3_A(0)	choose m{Edit - Sort} from the menu. 

=M_DLG_USAGE_SORT_P4(0)	The dialogue box contains the following entry fields: 

=M_DLG_USAGE_SORT_P4_A(0)	f{Data stock}: If sorting of more than one data stock is possible, this field allows the selection of the data stock to sort. 

=M_DLG_USAGE_SORT_P4_B(0)	f{Primary data field}: Choose here the data field to sort by. 

=M_DLG_USAGE_SORT_P4_C(0)	f{Secondary data field}: Here optionally you can select a second data field. This data field determines the sort order for data sets, which have the same contents in the primary data field. 

=M_DLG_USAGE_SORT_P4_D(0)	f{Range}: Here you can select, to which data sets the sorting should be applied. This entry field is only available, if several records had been selected before. In this case you can decide, whether only the selected or all data sets of the respective data stock should be sorted. 

=M_DLG_USAGE_SORT_P4_E(0)	f{Modus}: Here you can determine, whether the sorting should be ascending (smaller value first) or descending (bigger value first). 

=M_DLG_USAGE_SORT_P4_F(0)	f{Sort}: Press this button to start the sorting. 

=M_DLG_USAGE_SORT_P5(0)	Note: 

=M_DLG_USAGE_SORT_P5_A(0)	The command m{Edit - Sort} is only available, if one of the data lists is in unsorted display mode. You can set up unsorted display mode using the dialogue 'Edit Line Form' (see. Chap. IV-2, {'Line Formatting and Sorting'}->DLG_USAGE_LINE). 

=M_DLG_USAGE_SEARCH(0)	Searching for Data Sets 

=M_DLG_USAGE_SEARCH_P1(0)	To quickly find a specific record within a large amount of data sets, the data lists offer a positioning search function. 

=M_DLG_USAGE_SEARCH_P2(0)	To begin a search, just type in the first letter of the search term. The dialogue box w{Search} opens and the given letter appears in the field f{Search for}. 

=M_DLG_USAGE_SEARCH_P3(1)	Positioning Search 

=M_DLG_USAGE_SEARCH_P4(0)	The dialogue offers the following entry fields: 

=M_DLG_USAGE_SEARCH_P4_A(0)	f{Search for}: Enter the text phrases here you want to search for. Multiple search terms will be combined by a logical AND, i.e. only those records will be found, wich contain all the given search terms. Multiple search terms have to be separated by whitespace. 

=M_DLG_USAGE_SEARCH_P4_B(0)	f{Data field}: Here you can select the data field to search in. All the data fields being displayed in the list are available. The available set of data fields can be defined by the line format of the list (see Chap. IV-2, {'Lineform and Sorting'}->DLG_USAGE_LINE). If you want to search all data fields, choose 'All' here. 

=M_DLG_USAGE_SEARCH_P5(0)	Complete your input in the field f{Search for} and click f{Search} resp. press the k{Return} key. The dialogue box will close and the matching records will be selected in the list. If the list allows only single record selection, the list will focus the first matching record. If no record matches the search criteria, the dialogue box will keep open and a respective message will be given. 

=M_DLG_USAGE_SEARCH_P6(1)	Extended Search 

=M_DLG_USAGE_SEARCH_P7(0)	In the w{Lists View}->LST and in the w{System Matrix}->MTRX an extended search function is available, which can be reached as follows: 

=M_DLG_USAGE_SEARCH_P7_A(0)	Click on i{BTN_DLG_SEARCH.BMP} in the toolbar, or 

=M_DLG_USAGE_SEARCH_P7_B(0)	select m{Edit - Search} from the menu. 

=M_DLG_USAGE_SEARCH_P8(0)	The dialogue box of the extended search offers the control elements of the positioning search and additionally the following entry fields: 

=M_DLG_USAGE_SEARCH_P8_A(0)	f{Data stock}: In the w{System Matrix}->MTRX here you choose the data stock to search. In the w{Lists View}->LST this is not necessary, always the active data stock will be searched. 

=M_DLG_USAGE_SEARCH_P8_B(0)	f{Action}: Here you define how to proceed with the search result. If you choose 'Select' the matching records will be selected in the list. This corresponds to the behaviour of the positioning search. If you choose 'Filter' the search criteria will be used as filter, i.e. only the records matching the search criteria will be displayed in the list. In order to indicate, that only a selection of the available records is visible, the button 'Search' in the toolbar remains pressed resp. the menue entry appears checked. By clicking again the toolbar button resp. reselecting the menue entry the filter can be deactivated. In addition in the w{Lists View}->LIST the filter will be deactivated automatically by changing the active list. 

=M_DLG_USAGE_CLIPBOARD(0)	Using the clipboard to copy and paste records 

=M_DLG_USAGE_CLIPBOARD_P1(0)	In the w{Lists View}->LST and in the w{System Matrix}->MTRX it is possible to copy and paste records using the clipboard. This way you can copy records within a file, but also from one file to another. Using the clipboard it is also possible to import data from an external text file or table sheet to LOCKBASE. 

=M_DLG_USAGE_CLIPBOARD_P2(0)	To copy records to the clipboard, first you have to mark the records to copy. In the w{Lists View} you have to activate the resp. list to do so (refer to Chap. V, {The Lists View}->LST). Then 

=M_DLG_USAGE_CLIPBOARD_P2_A(0)	click to i{BTN_DLG_COPY.BMP} resp. i{BTN_DLG_COPY_COL.BMP} in the toolbar, or 

=M_DLG_USAGE_CLIPBOARD_P2_B(0)	select the command m{Edit - Copy} resp. m{Edit - Copy (Columns)} or m{Edit - Copy (Lines)}. 

=M_DLG_USAGE_CLIPBOARD_P3(0)	The selected records will be copied to the clipboard. Subsequently the commands to paste records will become available. To paste records from the clipboard, first you have to position the list cursor to the insert position. Then 

=M_DLG_USAGE_CLIPBOARD_P3_A(0)	click to i{BTN_DLG_PASTE.BMP} resp. i{BTN_DLG_PASTE_COL.BMP} in the toolbar, or 

=M_DLG_USAGE_CLIPBOARD_P3_B(0)	select m{Edit - Paste} resp. m{Edit - Paste (Columns)} or m{Edit - Paste (Lines)}. 

=M_DLG_USAGE_CLIPBOARD_P4(1)	The dialogue box w{Paste records} 

=M_DLG_USAGE_CLIPBOARD_P5(0)	To define how to paste records from the clipboard, the dialogue w{Paste records} opens. The dialogue box offers the following control elements: 

=M_DLG_USAGE_CLIPBOARD_P5_A(0)	f{Paste mode}: Here you can define, whether the records from the clipboard should be added or the selected records should be overwritten with the data from the clipboard. This choice is only available, if records were selected before running the paste command. 

=M_DLG_USAGE_CLIPBOARD_P5_B(0)	f{Surplus records}: In case the selected records should be overwritten with the data from the clipboard, here you can define how to proceed, if the clipboard contains more records than the selection in the list. Choose 'Add' to insert surplus records after the selection or 'Ignore' to modify only the selected records. This choice is only available if in replace mode the clipboard contains too many records. 

=M_DLG_USAGE_CLIPBOARD_P5_C(0)	f{Column separator}: In case data should be inserted from an external file, here you have to define, which character was used to separate the columns. When inserting external data by default each line will be regarded to represent one record. But how the single columns, which represent the LOCKBASE data fields, should be distinguished, has to be defined explicitly by choosing a column separator sign. You can choose between comma, semicolon and white space (space characters or tabs). If the separator symbol was used in the contents of one of the columns, the resp. column must be surrounded by double quotation marks ("). This choice is only available when pasting data from an external data source. 

=M_DLG_USAGE_CLIPBOARD_P6(0)	Note: 

=M_DLG_USAGE_CLIPBOARD_P6_A(0)	Using the clipboard records can be copied, but it is not possible to copy connections. If you want to copy or insert a complete master key system, you have to copy each data stock separately, one by one, and afterwards create the connections manually. To import complete master key systems from external files, the import interface for CSV files is a better choice (refer to Chap. III-1, {'Data import from CSV files'}->MAIN_FILE_OPEN_IMPORT_CSV). 

=M_DLG_GROUPS(0)	3. Moving in the Group Structure 

=M_DLG_GROUPS_P1(0)	If your LOCKBASE package includes the w{System Designer}->DSGN you can set up hierarchical structured master key systems or analyse already existing systems on their hidden group structure. 

=M_DLG_GROUPS_P2(0)	If a master key system is built up of hierarchical structured groups (refer to Chap. VIII-1, {'Analysing Master Key Systems'}->DSGN_ANALYSE), the name of the active group appears in the toolbars of w{Data Lists}->LST and w{System Matrix}->MTRX. If you want to add or delete a key function or cylinder data set or if you want to add or remove connections between key functions and cylinders, the active group has to be a subgroup which has no further subgroups itself (the leaf of a tree). 

=M_DLG_GROUPS_P3(0)	To change into a certain subgroup, 

=M_DLG_GROUPS_P3_A(0)	click on the group list in the toolbar and mark a group or 

=M_DLG_GROUPS_P3_B(0)	select the command m{Edit - Select Group} or 

=M_DLG_GROUPS_P3_C(0)	press key k{Ctrl+G}. 

=M_DLG_GROUPS_P4(0)	After you have selected a subgroup, only the data sets belonging to the this group are displayed. 

=M_DLG_GROUPS_P5(1)	The group list in the toolbar 

=M_DLG_GROUPS_P6(0)	Note: 

=M_DLG_GROUPS_P6_A(0)	In an analysed, hierarchical master key system only data sets of a subgroup can be added, because otherwise the group structure might be destroyed. Before you can add, delete or connect data sets you have to select a bottom level subgroup. 

=M_LST(0)	V. The Data Lists 

=M_LST_P1(1)	The window w{Data Lists} with Department and Key Holder List (a), Key Function List (b), Cylinder List (c), Location and Door List (d). The dots (e) show the connections of the selected record of the active data stock with other records.

=M_LST_P2(0)	To open the w{Data Lists} 

=M_LST_P2_A(0)	click on i{BTN_MAIN_LST.BMP} in the toolbar or 

=M_LST_P2_B(0)	select the command m{Window - Open Data Lists} or 

=M_LST_P2_C(0)	choose the hotkey k{Ctrl+L}. 

=M_LST_P3(1)	The window w{Data Lists} is the presentation form of a master key system, in which the six data stocks departments, key holders, key functions, cylinders, doors and locations, are to be seen simultaneously next to each other on the screen. In the w{Data Lists} you can edit all data stocks. 

=M_LST_P4(0)	The w{Floor Plan} Module enables you to read in floor plans of buildings or departments and to display door data sets in the plan, which have been set up before. Thus the access of persons, the locking function of keys or the location of cylinders is open to clear, spatial administration (see Chap. V-4, {'The Floor Plan Module'}->LST_GROUNDPLAN). 

=M_LST_P5(0)	Operating the Data Lists Windows 

=M_LST_P6(1)	Only one of the six data stocks can be active. The active data stock can be recognised by the white window background, while the background of the inactive data stocks appear in a light gray. Before you can add, edit, connect or delete a data set, the respective data stock must be activated. 

=M_LST_P7(0)	To activate a data stock 

=M_LST_P7_A(1)	click by mouse into the resp. list or 

=M_LST_P7_B(0)	select command m{Window - Activate next Data Stock} resp. m{Window - Activate previous Data Stock} or 

=M_LST_P7_C(0)	press the k{Tab} key (to right) resp. k{Shift+Tab} (to left). 

=M_LST_P8(1)	To operate in another data stock in order to page in it, for example to have connections displayed, keep the k{Ctrl} key pressed. As long as the k{Ctrl} key keeps pressed, the active list will not change.

=M_LST_P9(0)	You can alter the width of the individual lists 

=M_LST_P9_A(0)	by shifting the border lines with the mouse. Move the mouse cursor to the border line. If it changes its shape, drag the border line to a position at will. Let go of the mouse key or 

=M_LST_P9_B(0)	by selecting the command m{Window - Active List full Size}. 

=M_LST_P10(0)	To alter order or widths of the data fields use the command m{Options - Line Form}->DLG_USAGE_LINE. 

=M_LST_P11(0)	The command m{Window - Show Floor Plan} switches between list and w{Floor Plan} view of the door data stock. A little hook appears in front the menu item if the w{Floor Plan} view is active. The button i{BTN_LST_GROUNDPLAN.BMP} in the toolbar serves the same purpose. 

=M_LST_EDIT(0)	1. Enter and Edit Data Sets 

=M_LST_EDIT_P1(0)	The w{Data Lists}->LST and the w{System Matrix}->MTRX offer three methods to enter data sets. You can create in one step 

=M_LST_EDIT_P1_A(0)	single data sets with individual information or 

=M_LST_EDIT_P1_B(0)	multiple identical data sets with a numbering or 

=M_LST_EDIT_P1_C(0)	multiple data sets with repeating information. 

=M_LST_EDIT_ADD(0)	Add Data Sets 

=M_LST_EDIT_ADD_P1(0)	First activate the data stock that you would like to add a data set to, then 

=M_LST_EDIT_ADD_P1_A(0)	click on i{BTN_LST_ADD.BMP} in the toolbar or 

=M_LST_EDIT_ADD_P1_B(0)	select the command m{Edit - Add} or 

=M_LST_EDIT_ADD_P1_C(0)	press the key k{Ins} or 

=M_LST_EDIT_ADD_P1_D(0)	select "<new>" at the end of the list (via click or mark and k{Enter}) to append a new data set. 

=M_LST_EDIT_ADD_P2(1)	A dialogue box corresponding to the active data stock opens to take in the data of a new set (refer to Chap. IV-1, {'Data Stocks and Connections'}->DLG_DATA, w{Departments}->DLG_DATA_DEPARTMENT, w{Key Holders}->DLG_DATA_OWNER, w{Key Functions}->DLG_DATA_FUNC, w{Cylinders}->DLG_DATA_CYL, w{Doors}->DLG_DATA_DOOR) or w{Locations}->DLG_DATA_LOCATION. 

=M_LST_EDIT_ADD_P3(0)	LOCKBASE provides the convenient possibility of creating multiple data sets in which a numbering occurs (e.g. change keys 800 to 825) in one step. 

=M_LST_EDIT_ADD_P4(0)	Use the following entry fields to do so: 

=M_LST_EDIT_ADD_P4_A(0)	f{From}, f{To}: Enter the start/end value of the numbering. 

=M_LST_EDIT_ADD_P4_B(0)	f{@ Serial No.}: With this button you can insert the @ sign to an entry field at your will. LOCKBASE replaces this sign with the numbering when it creates the data sets. You can insert the numbering in multiple entry fields. 

=M_LST_EDIT_ADD_P5(0)	In the other entry fields you can enter data which shall be identical for all the data sets. In the list the new data set will appear above the one focussed. 

=M_LST_EDIT_ADD_P6(0)	Notes: 

=M_LST_EDIT_ADD_P6_A(0)	In an analysed, hierarchical master key system only data sets of a subgroup can be added (refer to Chap. VIII-1, {'Analysing Master Key Systems'}->DSGN_ANALYSE). 

=M_LST_EDIT_ADD_P6_B(0)	The new data set appears above the selected one. 

=M_LST_EDIT_ADD_P6_C(0)	You can insert the @-sign directly via the keyboard. Generally it is the third character on a key. In this case press k{Alt+Ctrl+@}. 

=M_LST_EDIT_ADD_P6_D(0)	If the number in field f{To} is smaller than in field f{From} no data sets will be set up. 

=M_LST_EDIT_ADD_P6_E(0)	In version LOCKBASE w{Manager lite} you cannot add key functions and cylinders. Changes of the master key system's technical data can only be entered by the supplier of the master key system. 

=M_LST_EDIT_ADD_DEF(0)	Create Data Sets by Setting Defaults 

=M_LST_EDIT_ADD_DEF_P1(0)	LOCKBASE provides you a convenient possibility of simplifying and accelerating the compilation of data sets. 

=M_LST_EDIT_ADD_DEF_P2(0)	Assuming for example that you are compiling person data sets for the tenants of an apartment house. In all these data sets the address will be the same. So that in every data set the address boxes do not have to be filled in again, LOCKBASE provides the possibility of determining identical details as a default. Proceed as follows: 

=M_LST_EDIT_ADD_DEF_P2_A(0)	When starting the first data set put only the identical details into the dialogue box. 

=M_LST_EDIT_ADD_DEF_P2_B(0)	Select the button i{BTN_DLG_DEFAULT.BMP}. The dialogue box will afterwards already be occupied with these details when you start a new data set. 

=M_LST_EDIT_ADD_DEF_P2_C(0)	Set up your data sets as usual. 

=M_LST_EDIT_ADD_DEF_P3(0)	Notes: 

=M_LST_EDIT_ADD_DEF_P3_A(0)	The defaults apply until you change them again, and only as long as the master key system remains opened. You can change the defaults as often as you wish, but they are not stored in the master key system file. 

=M_LST_EDIT_ADD_DEF_P3_B(0)	If you want to delete the defaults then you delete the data in the entry fields and press the button f{Default} again. 

=M_LST_EDIT_EDIT(0)	Edit Data Sets 

=M_LST_EDIT_EDIT_P1(0)	In the w{Data Lists} key holders', key function, cylinder and door data sets can be edited. First activate the corresponding data stock and mark one or multiple data sets, then 

=M_LST_EDIT_EDIT_P1_A(0)	click on i{BTN_LST_EDIT.BMP} or 

=M_LST_EDIT_EDIT_P1_B(0)	select command m{Edit - Edit} or 

=M_LST_EDIT_EDIT_P1_C(0)	press key k{Enter} or 

=M_LST_EDIT_EDIT_P1_D(0)	double-click directly on the data set in the list. 

=M_LST_EDIT_EDIT_P2(0)	According to the activated data set a dialogue box opens, the entry fields of which are occupied by the selected data set. 

=M_LST_EDIT_EDIT_P3(0)	Editing the cylinder length using the asterisk-placeholder 

=M_LST_EDIT_EDIT_P4(0)	If multiple data sets were selected, only the data which are identical in all selected data sets appear in the dialogue box. In the other data fields you will find an asterisk (*). The asterisk represents the current contents of the data field. It can be used as a placeholder for the respective contents of the data field in each data set, like in Figure 2 (see above). If you delete the asterisk, the current contents of the data field will be lost. 

=M_LST_EDIT_DEL(0)	Delete Data Sets 

=M_LST_EDIT_DEL_P1(0)	In the w{Data Lists} data sets from all four data stocks can be deleted. First activate the data stock in which you wish to delete one or more data sets and mark it or them, then 

=M_LST_EDIT_DEL_P1_A(0)	click on i{BTN_LST_DEL.BMP} or 

=M_LST_EDIT_DEL_P1_B(0)	select the command m{Edit - Delete} or 

=M_LST_EDIT_DEL_P1_C(0)	press key k{Del}. 

=M_LST_EDIT_DEL_P2(0)	A security query protects you against accidental deletion. 

=M_LST_EDIT_DEL_P3(0)	Notes: 

=M_LST_EDIT_DEL_P3_A(0)	In an analysed, hierarchical master key system key functions and cylinder data sets can only be deleted when a single subgroup is displayed (refer to Chap. VIII-1, {'Analysing Master Key Systems'}->DSGN_ANALYSE). 

=M_LST_EDIT_DEL_P3_B(0)	In version LOCKBASE w{Manager lite} you cannot delete key functions and cylinders. Changes of the master key system's technical data can only be entered by the supplier of the master key system. 

=M_LST_EDIT_OVERDUE_KEYS(0)	Overdue Key Returns 

=M_LST_EDIT_OVERDUE_KEYS_P1(0)	If you enter a date of return when issuing keys (refer to Chap. IV-1, {'Key Copies'}->DLG_DATA_KEY), you can let display which keys have reached or exceeded the return date. 

=M_LST_EDIT_OVERDUE_KEYS_P2(0)	The dialogue box w{Overdue Key Returns} 

=M_LST_EDIT_OVERDUE_KEYS_P3(0)	To display overdue key returns 

=M_LST_EDIT_OVERDUE_KEYS_P3_A(0)	select the command m{Edit - Overdue Key Returns}. 

=M_LST_EDIT_OVERDUE_KEYS_P4(0)	The dialogue box w{Overdue Key Returns} appears. 

=M_LST_EDIT_OVERDUE_KEYS_P5(0)	In a list field all keys are displayed which return date is reached or exceeded. Clicking the button f{Format...} the appearance of the list can be changed (refer to Chap. IV-2, {'Line Format and Sorting'}->DLG_USAGE_LINE). 

=M_LST_EDIT_OVERDUE_KEYS_P6(0)	If desired LOCKBASE shows the key returns overdue automatically when opening the w{Data Lists}. 

=M_LST_EDIT_OVERDUE_KEYS_P7(0)	To display the overdue key returns automatically 

=M_LST_EDIT_OVERDUE_KEYS_P7_A(0)	select the command m{Options - Display Key Returns automatically}. 

=M_LST_EDIT_OVERDUE_KEYS_P8(0)	The menu entry gets a hook if the function is switched on. 

=M_LST_EDIT_OVERDUE_KEYS_P9(0)	Note: 

=M_LST_EDIT_OVERDUE_KEYS_P9_A(0)	So that LOCKBASE interprets the date of key return correctly, it must be entered in short date format (e.g. '1.9.1999', '5/31/00', '18.03.2000', etc.). Details referring to the weekday or time cannot be processed. 

=M_LST_EDIT_CONSISTENCY(0)	Consistency Check 

=M_LST_EDIT_CONSISTENCY_P1(0)	The dialogue box w{Consistency Check} 

=M_LST_EDIT_CONSISTENCY_P2(0)	After having completed the data entry you can perform a check of the inner consistency of the master key system. LOCKBASE will test whether the system follows the rules marked by checked boxes. If differences are found the corresponding data will be presented for modification. 

=M_LST_EDIT_CONSISTENCY_P3(0)	To open the dialogue box w{Consistency Check} 

=M_LST_EDIT_CONSISTENCY_P3_A(0)	select the command m{Edit - Consistency Check...} 

=M_LST_EDIT_CONSISTENCY_P4(0)	For a more detailed description of the command please refer to Chap. VI-2, {'Consistency Check'}->MTRX_EDIT_CONSISTENCY. 

=M_LST_CONNECT(0)	2. Connections between Data Sets 

=M_LST_CONNECT_P1(0)	Not only the data sets of the four data stocks belong to a master key system, but also the connections between the individual data sets. 

=M_LST_CONNECT_P2(0)	Connections or links symbolise a certain relationship between the data sets of the different data stocks. 

=M_LST_CONNECT_P3(0)	LOCKBASE manages the following three kinds of connections: 

=M_LST_CONNECT_P3_A(0)	!{Key Holder - Key}: The key holder is the owner of the connected keys. 

=M_LST_CONNECT_P3_B(0)	!{Cylinder - Key Function}: The cylinder is operated by the connected key function(s). 

=M_LST_CONNECT_P3_C(0)	!{Door - Cylinder}: The cylinder is installed in the connected door.Refer to one of the following topics: 

=M_LST_CONNECT_SET(0)	Set and Remove Connections between Data Sets 

=M_LST_CONNECT_SET_P1(0)	In the w{Data Lists} connections between all four data stocks can be produced or removed. 

=M_LST_CONNECT_SET_P2(0)	Proceed as follows: Activate the desired data stock and mark the data set, then 

=M_LST_CONNECT_SET_P2_A(0)	click on i{BTN_DLG_CONNECT.BMP} or 

=M_LST_CONNECT_SET_P2_B(0)	select command m{Edit - Connect} or 

=M_LST_CONNECT_SET_P2_C(0)	press key k{F9}. 

=M_LST_CONNECT_SET_P3(0)	The dialogue box w{Connect} opens. 

=M_LST_CONNECT_SET_P4(0)	For more information about how to operate the dialogue box w{Connect} refer to Chap. IV-1, {'Connections'}->DLG_DATA_CONNECT. 

=M_LST_CONNECT_SET_P5(0)	Notes: 

=M_LST_CONNECT_SET_P5_A(0)	If you activated the data stock key holders and the list of not connected data sets is empty, then no key copies were created or all copies were already issued. 

=M_LST_CONNECT_SET_P5_B(0)	Connections between key holders and keys can only be administrated if the key holder list is active. 

=M_LST_CONNECT_SET_P5_C(0)	In an analysed, hierarchical master key system connections between key function and cylinder data sets can only be edited when a subgroup is displayed. 

=M_LST_CONNECT_SET_P5_D(0)	In version the LOCKBASE w{Manager lite} you cannot connect key functions and cylinders. Changes of the master key system's technical data can only be entered by the supplier of the master key system. 

=M_LST_CONNECT_SHOW(0)	Display connected Data Sets 

=M_LST_CONNECT_SHOW_P1(0)	To check which data sets are connected to the marked data set of the active list, you can switch on the connection display. In the w{Data Lists} and w{System Matrix}->MTRX, data sets connected to each other are indicated by a red dot. 

=M_LST_CONNECT_SHOW_P1_A(0)	Click on i{BTN_LST_SHOWDOTS.BMP} or 

=M_LST_CONNECT_SHOW_P1_B(0)	select command m{Window - Show Connections}. 

=M_LST_CONNECT_SHOW_P2(0)	To get a better overall view with large master key systems you can fade out the not connected items. 

=M_LST_CONNECT_SHOW_P2_A(0)	Select the command m{Window - Show connected only}. 

=M_LST_CONNECT_SHOW_P3(0)	Notes: 

=M_LST_CONNECT_SHOW_P3_A(0)	If you selected multiple data sets, LOCKBASE marks those data sets with a red dot which are connected with !{all} highlighted data sets. This way you can proceed useful research functions. Would you like to know e.g. what keys do open a certain selection of doors, simply mark the corresponding doors. LOCKBASE now displays only those as connected key functions, that open all selected doors. 

=M_LST_CONNECT_SHOW_P3_B(0)	The connection display is switched off by default. 

=M_LST_CONNECT_SHOW_P3_C(0)	With the k{Shift}+[k{Arrow Key Right} or k{Left}], a mouse-click or two corresponding commands from the menu m{Window} you can jump into another data stock in order to page in it. 

=M_LST_GROUNDPLAN(0)	3. The Floor Plan Module 

=M_LST_GROUNDPLAN_P1(0)	The window w{Data Lists} showing a floor plan 

=M_LST_GROUNDPLAN_P2(0)	With the w{Floor Plan} module floor plans of the building can be read in, where the master key system is installed. You can insert and position previously created doors data sets and let display the access of key holders, the locking function of keys or the location of cylinders in spatial representation. 

=M_LST_GROUNDPLAN_P3(0)	To toggle between list and w{Floor Plan} representation of the doors 

=M_LST_GROUNDPLAN_P3_A(0)	click onto i{BTN_LST_GROUNDPLAN.BMP} in the toolbar or 

=M_LST_GROUNDPLAN_P3_B(0)	select the command m{Window - Show Floor Plan}. 

=M_LST_GROUNDPLAN_P4(1)	Above the plan in the control area of the doors list a slider control to adjust the zoom factor of the w{Floor Plan} representation can be found.

=M_LST_GROUNDPLAN_P5(1)	The slider control in the w{Floor Plan} view 

=M_LST_GROUNDPLAN_P7(0)	You can operate the w{Floor Plan} view by mouse or keyboard. For the operation by keyboard use the following key combinations: 

=M_LST_GROUNDPLAN_P7_A(1)	k{Tab} and k{Shift+Tab} move the focus between the control elements of the w{Floor Plan} module. 

=M_LST_GROUNDPLAN_P7_B(0)	k{Ctrl+Arrow Up} or k{Ctrl+Arrow Down} scroll the picture for one pixel line vertically. 

=M_LST_GROUNDPLAN_P7_C(0)	k{Ctrl+Arrow Left} or k{Ctrl+Arrow Right} scroll the picture for one pixel column horizontally. 

=M_LST_GROUNDPLAN_P7_D(0)	k{Ctrl+PgUp} or k{Ctrl+PgDn} scroll the picture for one page height vertically. 

=M_LST_GROUNDPLAN_P7_E(0)	k{Ctrl+Begin} or k{Ctrl+End} scroll the picture for one page width horizontally. 

=M_LST_GROUNDPLAN_P8(0)		Focusing, marking and selection of door data sets in the w{Floor Plan} works like in the other lists (refer to Chap. IV-2, {'Selecting Data Sets'}->DLG_USAGE_SELECT). 

=M_LST_GROUNDPLAN_P9(0)		Because the floor plans are included in the location data sets (see Chap. IV-1, {'Location Data Sets'}->DLG_DATA_LOCATION), you can add, edit and remove floor plans by adding, modifying and removing location data sets. Doors can be added to or removed from a floor plan by connecting them to resp. disconnecting them from the location data set of the floor plan (see Chap. IV-1, {'Connections'}->DLG_DATA_CONNECT).

=M_LST_GROUNDPLAN_P10(0)	In a new floor plan the assorted doors appear cascaded in the top left corner of the w{Floor Plan}, from where they can be moved to the desired position. 

=M_LST_GROUNDPLAN_P11(0)	To move a door data set in the w{Floor Plan} by mouse 

=M_LST_GROUNDPLAN_P11_A(0)	mark the data sets to move (see Chap. IV-2, {'Selecting Data Sets'}->DLG_USAGE_SELECT), then 

=M_LST_GROUNDPLAN_P11_B(0)	drag the data sets to the desired position. 

=M_LST_GROUNDPLAN_P12(0)	To move data sets in the w{Floor Plan} by keyboard 

=M_LST_GROUNDPLAN_P12_A(0)	mark the data sets to move (see Chap. IV-2, {'Selecting Data Sets'}->DLG_USAGE_SELECT), then 

=M_LST_GROUNDPLAN_P12_B(0)	press k{Shift+Ctrl+[Arrow Keys]} until the desired position is reached. 

=M_MTRX(0)	VI. The System Matrix 

=M_MTRX_P1(0)	The w{System Matrix} in Euro format displaying system cover sheet information (a), columns list (b), line list (c), matrix with connections of superior keys (d) and of central cylinders (e). 

=M_MTRX_P2(0)	To open the w{System Matrix} 

=M_MTRX_P2_A(0)	click on i{BTN_MAIN_MTRX.BMP} in the toolbar or 

=M_MTRX_P2_B(0)	select the command m{Window - Open System Matrix} or 

=M_MTRX_P2_C(0)	choose the hotkey k{Ctrl+S}. 

=M_MTRX_P3(0)	The window w{System Matrix} is the tabular presentation form of a master key system in which the data stocks key functions and cylinders as well as their connections are to be seen on the screen. You can edit both data stocks and their connections. 

=M_MTRX_P4(0)	The w{System Matrix} contains 4 views in the standard format respectively 6 views in the Euro format: 

=M_MTRX_P4_A(0)	Up left the w{System Cover Sheet}'s data is displayed. If you double-click on the view, the w{System Cover Sheet} opens. 

=M_MTRX_P4_B(0)	Up right the column list containing data sets are displayed. The Euro format shows one column list for the superior keys (left) and one for the central cylinders (right). The standard view displays only one column list that contains all key functions. You can edit a data set on double-clicking it. 

=M_MTRX_P4_C(0)	Down left a line list with data sets is displayed. It is standard that the cylinders are listed in lines on the left edge of the window. You can edit a data set on double-clicking it. 

=M_MTRX_P4_D(0)	Down right the matrices with connections are displayed. The Euro format shows one matrix for the superior key connections (left, displayed as 'X') and one for the central cylinder connections (right, displayed as 'I'). The standard view consists of one matrix only that contains all connections displayed as a red dot. An 'E' symbolises a change key function i.e. a connection between a cylinder and its change key. 

=M_MTRX_USAGE(0)	1. Handling the System Matrix Window 

=M_MTRX_USAGE_P1(0)	In the standard format (not Euro Matrix) the cylinders are listed in lines on the left edge of the window, while the key functions are listed in columns along the top edge. The arrangement of the data stocks can be swapped by the command m{Options - Layout...}. 

=M_MTRX_USAGE_P2(0)	In the w{System Matrix} two data sets are marked as a standard: A cylinder and a key function. With the aid of the Arrow keys k{Left} and k{Right} you can mark another column, with k{Up} and k{Down} you can mark another line. Furthermore, with a mouse click on an intersection of line and column you can shift both marks at once. Pressing the k{Spacebar} or double-clicking on an intersection switches the connection on and off. 

=M_MTRX_USAGE_P3(0)	You can change the partitioning of the w{System Matrix} window by dragging the border lines with the mouse. For the adjustment of the width display of the data fields serve the commands m{Options - Format Lines} and m{Options - Format Columns} (see also Chap. IV-2, {'Line Formatting and Sorting'}->DLG_USAGE_LINE). 

=M_MTRX_USAGE_P4(0)	The lines' height and columns' width depends on the display font. You can determine this font with the command m{Options - Font Data} (see also Chap. IV-2, {'Font Selection'}->DLG_USAGE_FONT). 

=M_MTRX_USAGE_P5(0)	With the command m{Options - Hide Cylinders keyed alike} you can control the display of cylinders keyed alike (see Chap. IV-1, {'Cylinder Data Sets'}->DLG_DATA_CYL). Activate this adjustment to let disappear cylinders keyed alike and display cylinders with different pinnings, only. 

=M_MTRX_USAGE_P6(0)	The command m{Options - System Matrix Setup...} opens the dialogue w{System Matrix Setup}, which allows to modify some settings of the System Matrix. 

=M_MTRX_USAGE_P7(0)	The dialogue box w{System Matrix Setup} 

=M_MTRX_USAGE_P8(0)	The dialogue offers the following entry fields: 

=M_MTRX_USAGE_P8_A(0)	f{Layout}: Select the layout here, whose settings you would like to modify. 

=M_MTRX_USAGE_P8_B(0)	f{Default}: This button allows to reset the contents of the entry fields to their default values. 

=M_MTRX_USAGE_P9(0)	In the area f{Connection Symbols} the connection symbols for the different layouts can be adjusted. 

=M_MTRX_USAGE_P9_A(0)	f{Master/Submaster Keys}: Enter the connection symbol for master and submaster keys here. 

=M_MTRX_USAGE_P9_B(0)	f{Change Keys}: Enter the connection symbol for change key connections here. 

=M_MTRX_USAGE_P9_C(0)	f{Central Cylinders}: Enter the connection symbol for central locks here. 

=M_MTRX_USAGE_P10(0)	Note: 

=M_MTRX_USAGE_P10_A(0)	You can enter the character sequence 'DOT' to use the red dot as the connection symbol. 

=M_MTRX_USAGE_EUROMATRIX(0)	Euro Matrix 

=M_MTRX_USAGE_EUROMATRIX_P1(0)	The Euro Matrix format consists of two matrices in one view. On the left hand side you find a matrix of the superior keys (top master key and master keys) listed vertically against the cylinders horizontally. On the right there is a second matrix of central cylinders listed vertically against cylinders' change keys horizontally. 

=M_MTRX_USAGE_EUROMATRIX_P2(0)	The connections between cylinders and their change keys are not shown in form of a matrix. If a cylinder owns a change key its name and number is displayed in the line of the corresponding cylinder dataset as a datafield. 

=M_MTRX_USAGE_EUROMATRIX_P3(0)	The Euro format makes the w{System Matrix} considerably more compact and gives a better overview; especially for big master key systems containing a lot of change keys the Euro Matrix is very helpful. 

=M_MTRX_USAGE_EUROMATRIX_P4(0)	The handling of the Euro Matrix is generally the same like in the standard view of the w{System Matrix} (see also Chap. VI-1, {'Handling the System Matrix Window'}->MTRX_USAGE). However, swapping lines and columns is not possible in the Euro format. 

=M_MTRX_USAGE_EUROMATRIX_P5(0)	Notes: 

=M_MTRX_USAGE_EUROMATRIX_P5_A(0)	To let appear cylinders in the list of central cylinders on the right hand side of the Euro Matrix, they must be marked as central cylinder in the w{Cylinder}'s dialogue box (see also Chap. IV-1, {'Cylinder Data Sets'}->DLG_DATA_CYL). 

=M_MTRX_USAGE_EUROMATRIX_P5_B(0)	A connection to a central cylinder is only possible if a change key was set up for the corresponding locking (refer to Chap. IV-1, {'Cylinder Data Sets'}->DLG_DATA_CYL). 

=M_MTRX_USAGE_MOVE(0)	Moving in the System Matrix 

=M_MTRX_USAGE_MOVE_P1(0)	The following keys serve to move the cursor and to quickly browse the display: 

=M_MTRX_USAGE_MOVE_P1_A(0)	k{Arrow keys}: One line or column to the corresponding direction 

=M_MTRX_USAGE_MOVE_P1_B(0)	k{PgUp}, k{PgDn}: One screen page up, down 

=M_MTRX_USAGE_MOVE_P1_C(0)	k{Ctrl+PgUp}, k{Ctrl+PgDn}: One screen page left, right 

=M_MTRX_USAGE_MOVE_P1_D(0)	k{Home}, k{End}: To the first/last horizontal data set 

=M_MTRX_USAGE_MOVE_P1_E(0)	k{Ctrl+Home}, k{Ctrl+End}: To the first/last vertical data set 

=M_MTRX_USAGE_MOVE_P1_F(0)	k{Ctrl+Arrow Up}, k{Ctrl+Arrow Down}: Scrolling one line in the column list 

=M_MTRX_USAGE_MOVE_P1_G(0)	k{Ctrl+Arrow Left}, k{Ctrl+Arrow Right}: Scrolling one line in the line list. 

=M_MTRX_EDIT(0)	2. Enter and edit data sets 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_P1(0)	The w{System Matrix} offers three methods to enter data sets. You can create in one step 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_P1_A(0)	single data sets with individual information or 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_P1_B(0)	several identical data sets with a numbering or 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_P1_C(0)	several data sets with repeating information. 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_ADD(0)	Add Data Sets 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_ADD_P1(0)	To add one or multiple data sets to the focused column list: 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_ADD_P1_A(0)	Click on i{BTN_MTRX_ADDCOL.BMP} in the toolbar or 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_ADD_P1_B(0)	choose the command m{Edit - Add (Columns)...} or 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_ADD_P1_C(0)	press the button k{Ctrl+Ins} or 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_ADD_P1_D(0)	double-click on the entry <new> in the corresponding columns list. 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_ADD_P2(0)	To add one or multiple data sets to the focused line list: 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_ADD_P2_A(0)	Click on i{BTN_MTRX_ADDROW.BMP} in the toolbar or 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_ADD_P2_B(0)	choose the command m{Edit - Add (Lines)} or 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_ADD_P2_C(0)	press the button k{Ins} or 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_ADD_P2_D(0)	double-click the entry <new> in the line list. 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_ADD_P3(0)	According to the list's content the corresponding dialogue box opens: Either the dialogue box w{Key Function}->DLG_DATA_FUNC or the dialogue box w{Cylinder}->DLG_DATA_CYL. 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_ADD_P4(0)	LOCKBASE provides the convenient possibility of creating several data sets in which a numbering occurs (e.g. keys 800 to 825) in one step. 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_ADD_P5(0)	Use the following entry fields to do so: 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_ADD_P5_A(0)	f{From}, f{To}: Enter the start/end value of the numbering. 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_ADD_P5_B(0)	f{@ Serial No.}: With this button you insert the @-sign to an entry field at your will. LOCKBASE replaces this sign with the numbering when it creates the data sets. It is possible to insert the numbering in several data fields. 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_ADD_P6(0)	In the other entry fields you enter data which should be identical in all new data sets. 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_ADD_P7(0)	Notes: 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_ADD_P7_A(0)	The new data set appears in the list above, resp. left next to the one last marked. 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_ADD_P7_B(0)	In an analysed, hierarchical master key system, data sets can only be added to a subgroup. 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_ADD_P7_C(0)	You can insert the @-sign directly via the keyboard. Often a key is used by @ as the third character so that you have to press k{Alt+Ctrl+@}. 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_ADD_P7_D(0)	If the value in the entry field f{To} is smaller than the value in the entry field f{From}, no data sets are created. 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_ADD_DEF(0)	Create Data Sets by Setting Defaults 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_ADD_DEF_P1(0)	LOCKBASE provides you a convenient possibility of simplifying and accelerating the compilation of data sets. Assuming for example that you are compiling person data sets for the tenants of an appartment house. In all these data sets the address will be the same. 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_ADD_DEF_P2(0)	To create data sets by setting default values, proceed as follows: 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_ADD_DEF_P2_A(0)	When starting the first data set put only the identical details into the dialogue box. 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_ADD_DEF_P2_B(0)	Select the button i{BTN_DLG_DEFAULT.BMP}. The dialogue box will afterwards already be occupied with these details when you start a new data set. 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_ADD_DEF_P2_C(0)	Set up your data sets as usual. 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_ADD_DEF_P3(0)	Notes: 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_ADD_DEF_P3_A(0)	The defaults apply until you change them again, and only as long as the master key system remains open. 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_ADD_DEF_P3_B(0)	If you want to delete the defaults, then delete the data in the entry fields and press the button f{Default} again. 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_EDIT(0)	Edit Data Sets 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_EDIT_P1(0)	To edit one or multiple key function or cylinder data sets, first you have to mark the desired data set(s). 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_EDIT_P2(0)	To edit data sets in the focused columns list, 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_EDIT_P2_A(0)	click on i{BTN_MTRX_EDITCOL.BMP} in the toolbar or 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_EDIT_P2_B(0)	select the command m{Edit - Edit (Columns),} or 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_EDIT_P2_C(0)	press the keys k{Ctrl+Enter} or 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_EDIT_P2_D(0)	double-click directly on the data set. 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_EDIT_P3(0)	To edit data sets in the focused line list, 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_EDIT_P3_A(0)	click on i{BTN_MTRX_EDITROW.BMP} in the toolbar or 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_EDIT_P3_B(0)	select the command m{Edit - Edit (Lines)} or 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_EDIT_P3_C(0)	press the keys k{Enter} or 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_EDIT_P3_D(0)	double-click directly on the data set in the list. 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_EDIT_P4(0)	According to the list's content the corresponding dialogue box opens: Either the dialogue box w{Key Function}->DLG_DATA_FUNC or the dialogue box w{Cylinder}->DLG_DATA_CYL. Your entry fields are occupied by the data of the selected data sets. 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_EDIT_P5(0)	Editing the cylinder length using the asterisk-placeholder 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_EDIT_P6(0)	If multiple data sets were selected, only the data which are identical in all selected sets appear in the dialogue box. In the other data fields you will find an asterisk (*). The asterisk represents the current contents of the data field. It can be used as a placeholder for the respective contents of the data field in each data set, like in Figure 2 (see above). If you delete the asterisk, the current contents of the data field will be lost. 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_EDIT_P7(0)	Note: 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_EDIT_P7_A(0)	To edit multiple data sets you can also use the automatical numbering by entering the data fields f{From} and f{To} as well as using the '@' character. 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_DEL(0)	Delete Data Sets 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_DEL_P1(0)	In the w{System Matrix} you can delete key function and cylinder data sets. Before, you have to mark the data set(s) to delete. Then proceed as follows. 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_DEL_P2(0)	To delete one or multiple data sets in a column list, 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_DEL_P2_A(0)	click on i{BTN_MTRX_DELCOL.BMP} in the toolbar or 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_DEL_P2_B(0)	select the command m{Edit - Delete (Columns)} or 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_DEL_P2_C(0)	press key k{Ctrl+Del}. 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_DEL_P3(0)	To delete one or multiple data sets in the line list 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_DEL_P3_A(0)	click on i{BTN_MTRX_DELROW.BMP} in the toolbar or 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_DEL_P3_B(0)	select the command m{Edit - Delete (Lines)} or 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_DEL_P3_C(0)	press key k{Del}. 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_DEL_P4(0)	A security query protects you against accidental deletion. 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_DEL_P5(0)	Note: 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_DEL_P5_A(0)	In an analysed, hierarchical master key system, data sets can only be deleted if a subgroup is displayed. 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_CONSISTENCY(0)	Consistency Check 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_CONSISTENCY_P1(0)	The dialogue box w{Consistency Check} 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_CONSISTENCY_P2(0)	After having completed the data entry, you can perform a check of the inner consistency of the master key system. LOCKBASE will test whether the system follows the rules marked by checked boxes. If differences are found, the corresponding data will be presented for modification. 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_CONSISTENCY_P3(0)	To open the dialogue box w{Consistency Check} 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_CONSISTENCY_P3_A(0)	select the command m{Edit - Consistency Check...} 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_CONSISTENCY_P4(0)	The dialogue box contains the following entry fields and control elements: 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_CONSISTENCY_P4_A(0)	f{No Duplicate Key Functions}: If this box is checked, LOCKBASE looks for duplicate key function names (field f{Function} in the key function data set, see Chap. IV-1, {'Key Function Data Sets'}->DLG_DATA_FUNC). 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_CONSISTENCY_P4_B(0)	f{No Duplicate Cylinder Functions}: If this box is checked, LOCKBASE looks for duplicate names of cylinder functions (field f{Number} in the cylinder data set, see Chap. IV-1, {'Cylinder Data Sets'}->DLG_DATA_CYL). Cylinder functions are the 'master' cylinders of keyed alike groups; which means this rule checks only, that cylinders keyed differently also have different names, while cylinders keyed alike can have the same name. 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_CONSISTENCY_P4_C(0)	f{No Duplicate Cylinder Numbers}: If this box is checked, LOCKBASE looks for duplicate cylinder numbers (field f{Number} in the cylinder data set, see Chap. IV-1, {'Cylinder Data Sets'}->DLG_DATA_CYL). In contrast to the rule f{No Duplicate Cylinder Function}, here all cylinders will be checked. 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_CONSISTENCY_P4_D(0)	f{Change Key Equals Cylinder}: If this box is checked, LOCKBASE tests whether all change keys got the same name as the cylinder they belong to, i.e. whether the contents of the field f{Number} of the cylinder data set equals the contents of the field f{Function} of the belonging change key (see also Chap. IV-1, {'Cylinder Data Sets'}->DLG_DATA_CYL and Chap. IV-1, {'Key Function Data Sets'}->DLG_DATA_FUNC). 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_CONSISTENCY_P4_E(0)	f{Combine Cylinders Keyed Alike}: If this box is checked, all cylinders keyed alike will be combined to a cylinder function. The first cylinder in unsorted order of each cylinder function, will be the 'master' (see Chap. IV-1, {'Cylinder Data Sets'}->DLG_DATA_CYL). 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_CONSISTENCY_P4_F(0)	f{Check Now}: By pressing this button, you start the consistency check. The master key system will be searched for breaks of the rules defined above. Detected errors will be displayed in the field f{Consistency Errors} and can be corrected there (s.b.). 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_CONSISTENCY_P4_G(0)	f{Close}: This button closes the dialogue box without performing a consistency check. 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_CONSISTENCY_P4_H(0)	{Actual Value}: This field shows the current value of the data field that causes the error, as a rule a key function or a cylinder number. 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_CONSISTENCY_P4_I(0)	f{Change to}: This field contains a suggestion, how to modify the value to pass the check. However, you can change the contents of this field according to your needs. 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_CONSISTENCY_P4_J(0)	f{Ignore}: Press this button to continue the search without correcting the error. 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_CONSISTENCY_P4_K(0)	f{Change}: Press this button to change the current value into the one displayed in the field f{Change to}. 

=M_MTRX_EDIT_CONSISTENCY_P4_L(0)	f{Abort}: Press this button to abort the searching process. 

=M_MTRX_CONNECT(0)	3. Connecting Data Sets 

=M_MTRX_CONNECT_P1(0)	To set and remove connections between key functions and cylinders in the w{System Matrix}, 

=M_MTRX_CONNECT_P1_A(0)	double-click on the intersection of column and line or 

=M_MTRX_CONNECT_P1_B(0)	mark two data sets you want to connect and press the k{Spacebar}. 

=M_MTRX_CONNECT_P2(0)	In this way you can switch connections between the selected items on and off. 

=M_MTRX_CONNECT_P3(0)	If you want to connect several data sets in one pass, select one or multiple data sets, 

=M_MTRX_CONNECT_P3_A(0)	click on i{BTN_DLG_CONNECT.BMP} in the toolbar or 

=M_MTRX_CONNECT_P3_B(0)	select command m{Edit - Connect}. 

=M_MTRX_CONNECT_P4(0)	The dialogue box w{Connect} opens (refer to Chap. IV-1, {'Connections'}->DLG_DATA_CONNECT). 

=M_MTRX_CONNECT_P5(0)	In the standard view of the w{System Matrix}, data sets connected to each other are indicated by a red dot. The Euro Format (see also Chap. VI-1, {'Euro Matrix'}->MTRX_USAGE_EUROMATRIX) displays connections between superordinated keys and cylinders by a red 'X'. Connections between central cylinders and change keys are shown by a red 'I'. Connections between cylinders and their change keys are indicated by a red 'E'. 

=M_CALC(0)	VII. The Calculator 

=M_CALC_P1(0)	The window w{Calculator} with the entry fields (a), the w{Group Structure} display (b), the key functions' list (c) and the list of cylinders (d). In the w{Group Structure} view superordinated groups (= nodes, they contain subgroups) are displayed oval, whereas subgroups are displayed rectangularily. 

=M_CALC_P2(0)	To open the w{Calculator} proceed as follows: 

=M_CALC_P2_A(0)	Click on i{BTN_MAIN_CALC.BMP} in the toolbar or 

=M_CALC_P2_B(0)	select the command m{Window - Open Calculator} or 

=M_CALC_P2_C(0)	choose the hotkey k{Ctrl+R}. 

=M_CALC_P3(0)	The w{Calculator} window is the LOCKBASE calculation program for tracing the key bittings and cylinder pinnings of a master key system. It is presumed that key and cylinder data sets have been established and that the data sets are connected according to the required functionality (refer to Chap. V, {'The Data Lists'}->LST and Chap. VI, {'The System Matrix'}->MTRX). The w{Calculator} is included in the LOCKBASE versions w{Calculator} and w{Professional}. 

=M_CALC_P4(0)	The w{Calculator} consists of four areas: 

=M_CALC_P4_A(0)	The entry field for the brand and the code group are located upside (see below). 

=M_CALC_P4_B(0)	Down left the group structure of the system is shown if it was analysed and has got a hierarchical structure (refer to Chap. VIII-1, {'Analysing Master Key Systems'}->DSGN_ANALYSE). 

=M_CALC_P4_C(0)	In the lower middle window area a list of key functions with their combinations is shown, in case the system is already calculated. Before the calculation starts the list contains only the combinations of the master keys which have been set for nodes and subgroups in the dialogue box w{Edit Key Bitting Array}->CALC_KBA, presuming a master key exists. During the calculation the combinations for the other key functions are subsequently added. 

=M_CALC_P4_D(0)	You find a list of cylinders in the lower right window area. This cylinders' list allows to define pre-settings for the calculation of multiple cylinders and displays their result after calculation. 

=M_CALC_P5(0)	Before the group names, symbols are displayed which indicate the editing state of the system: 

=M_CALC_P5_A(0)	the "!{-}" symbol appears if a node's key bitting array has been edited, but not yet all of its subgroups. 

=M_CALC_P5_B(0)	the "!{+}" symbol appears if a subgroup's key bitting array has been edited. When all the subgroups of a node have been edited, the "!{-}" symbol of the node changes to a "!{+}" symbol. 

=M_CALC_P5_C(0)	the "!{*}" symbol appears if all combinations of a group have been calculated. 

=M_CALC_P6(0)	You can alter the layout of the w{Calculator} window by dragging the splitter bars with your mouse between the group structure display, the key functions' list and the cylinders' list. 

=M_CALC_P7(0)	You can move between the four areas by mouse-click or by pressing the k{Tab} key. k{Tab} also moves the mark through the entry fields of the control panel. 

=M_CALC_P8(0)	The following entry fields are available: 

=M_CALC_P8_A(0)	f{Brand}: Select the cylinder brand from the list f{Brand}, the master key system should be built with. In the brands' list appear those brand modules which you bought together with your LOCKBASE version. In case the w{Code Group Administration} is part of your package, choose a brand by selecting the command m{Edit - Code Group Administration} (refer to Chap. VII-2, {'Code Group Administration'}->CALC_CGA). 

=M_CALC_P8_B(0)	f{Code Group}: Enter a valid code group for the chosen brand. From left to right the designators correspond to the cuts from bow to tip of the key. Like the brand, the code group applies for the entire master key system. The patterns you can use differ from brand to brand (refer to Chap. VII-7, {'Cylinder Brands and Code Groups'}->CALC_BRANDS). In case the w{Code Group Administration} is part of your package, choose the code group by selecting the command m{Edit - Code Group Administration} (refer to Chap. VII-2, {'Code Group Administration'}->CALC_CGA). 

=M_CALC_P8_C(0)	f{Setup}: This button is available if you use brands, where some settings for the calculation can be modified. In that case a brand specific dialogue box opens. 

=M_CALC_STEPS(0)	1. Steps to calculate a Master Key System 

=M_CALC_STEPS_P1(0)	To calculate a master key system you have to proceed as follows: 

=M_CALC_STEPS_P1_A(0)	First enter all key functions, cylinders and their connections in the w{Data Lists}->LST, the w{System Matrix}->MTRX or the w{System Designer}->DSGN. 

=M_CALC_STEPS_P1_B(0)	Select the brand from the f{Brand} list in the w{Calculator}. If the w{Code Group Administration} is part of your LOCKBASE program package, you set the brand during selecting a code group (refer to Chap. VII-2, {'Code Group Administration'}->CALC_CGA). 

=M_CALC_STEPS_P1_C(0)	In the entry field f{Code Group} enter a valid code group for the chosen brand. Like the brand, the code group applies for the entire master key system. The patterns you can use differ from brand to brand (refer to Chap. VII-7, {'Cylinder Brands and Code Groups'}->CALC_BRANDS). If the w{Code Group Administration} is part of your LOCKBASE program package, you select a code group in the w{Code Group Administration} (refer to Chap. VII-2, {'Code Group Administration'}->CALC_CGA). 

=M_CALC_STEPS_P1_D(0)	Mark subsequently all the groups in the w{Group Structure} view. Call the dialogue box w{Edit Key Bitting Array}. Set or confirm the key bitting array and the keyways (refer to Chap. VII-3, {'Edit the Key Bitting Array'}->CALC_KBA). 

=M_CALC_STEPS_P1_E(0)	Click on i{BTN_CALC_CALC.BMP} or select the command m{Edit - Calculate}. A 'thinking bubble' appears and indicates that the system is currently being calculated. When LOCKBASE has finished or cancelled the calculation, a message appears. 

=M_CALC_STEPS_P1_F(0)	After the master key system has been calculated, you have to transfer the calculation results (key codes and cylinder pinnings) to the database. Click on i{BTN_CALC_TRANSFER.BMP} in the toolbar or select the command m{Edit - Transfer} in the menu (refer to Chap. VII-6, {'Transfer'}->CALC_TRANSFER). 

=M_CALC_STEPS_P2(0)	i{GROUP_MAIN.BMP} If you only see a single rectangle with a system number, the following reasons may apply: 

=M_CALC_STEPS_P2_A(0)	You did not {analyse}->DSGN_ANALYSE the group structure or 

=M_CALC_STEPS_P2_B(0)	the master key system has no group structure or 

=M_CALC_STEPS_P2_C(0)	you are working with a LOCKBASE version without w{System Designer}->DSGN or 

=M_CALC_STEPS_P2_D(0)	you have {merged}->DSGN_ANALYSE_MERGE the group structure. 

=M_CALC_STEPS_P3(0)	In each of these cases you can edit the key bitting array only for the entire master key system. 

=M_CALC_STEPS_P4(0)	If the calculation fails because of too much complexity, you have the following options: 

=M_CALC_STEPS_P4_A(0)	enlarge the key bitting array of the master key system or 

=M_CALC_STEPS_P4_B(0)	calculate with more keyways (refer to Chap. VII-3, {'Edit the Key Bitting Array'}->CALC_KBA). 

=M_CALC_STEPS_P5(0)	Security Note: 

=M_CALC_STEPS_P5_A(0)	If the w{Code Group Administration} is not part of your LOCKBASE package, it is necessary to administer the used code groups to avoid an overlap of the combination ranges of different master key systems. 

=M_CALC_STEPS_P6(0)	Notes: 

=M_CALC_STEPS_P6_A(0)	In an analysed, hierarchical system you have to set the key bitting array for each node and subgroup beginning at top level. The key bitting array of an upper element has to include the key bitting array of its subgroups, whereas their key bitting arrays have to differ in at least one position. Then the command m{Calculate} is available. 

=M_CALC_STEPS_P6_B(0)	In w{Key Functions} and w{Cylinders} list only keys resp. cylinders that belong to the element marked in the w{Group Structure} display are boldly presented. All other key functions appear pale. 

=M_CALC_STEPS_P6_C(0)	Analysing a master key system for its group structure is advantageous so that the key bitting array can be divided up according to the respective group size. Faults resp. too generously or tightly dimensioned key bitting arrays become more quickly apparent. 

=M_CALC_STEPS_P6_D(0)	The LOCKBASE w{Calculator} automatically excludes certain combinations from use. To these belong for example more than two equally deep adjacent cuts or more than three equally deep cuts at all (with five pin brands), cut sequences rising or falling like stairs as well as combinations that cannot be cut due to overlapping. 

=M_CALC_CGA(0)	2. Code Group Administration 

=M_CALC_CGA_P1(0)	The w{Code Group Administration} with toolbar (a), list of code groups (b), status fields and list of usage (d) 

=M_CALC_CGA_P2(0)	The w{Code Group Administration} supports a systematic administration of code groups used for calculation to avoid an unrecognised overlapping of the combination ranges of different master key systems. 

=M_CALC_CGA_P3(0)	To start the w{Code Group Administration}, 

=M_CALC_CGA_P3_A(0)	click on i{BTN_CALC_CGA.BMP} in the toolbar or 

=M_CALC_CGA_P3_B(0)	select the command m{Edit - Code Group Administration...} or 

=M_CALC_CGA_P3_C(0)	press the key k{F3}. 

=M_CALC_CGA_P4(0)	The w{Code Group Administration} is not available before at least one key function and one cylinder is present. 

=M_CALC_CGA_FIELDS(0)	The Entry Fields of the Code Group Administration 

=M_CALC_CGA_FIELDS_P1(0)	The w{Code Group Administration} window divides into four areas. 

=M_CALC_CGA_FIELDS_P2(0)	At the top the toolbar is located. It serves to navigate through the tree of code groups and contains the following elements: 

=M_CALC_CGA_FIELDS_P2_A(0)	f{Find in}: This field displays the superordinated code group the current visible code groups in the main window were derived from. The field f{Find in} serves to quickly navigate upwards in the tree of code groups. 

=M_CALC_CGA_FIELDS_P2_B(0)	i{BTN_CGA_UP.BMP} f{Move one level upwards}: Use this command to move one level upwards in relation to the code groups displayed in the main window. 

=M_CALC_CGA_FIELDS_P2_C(0)	i{BTN_CGA_OVERVIEW.BMP} f{Overview display}: Use this command to display the code groups in a way which allows a better overview. The code groups will be displayed in multiple columns which leads to a better overview but without their respective descriptions. 

=M_CALC_CGA_FIELDS_P2_D(0)	i{BTN_CGA_DETAILED.BMP} f{Detailed display}: Use this command to display the code groups in a more detailed way. They will be displayed only in one column but with their description beside. 

=M_CALC_CGA_FIELDS_P2_E(0)	i{BTN_CGA_SPLIT.BMP} f{Split the selected code group}: Use this command to split the selected code group in the main window into smaller units. If there are different ways to split up a code group the dialogue box w{Split a Code Group} appears (see Chap. VII-2, {'How to split up Code Groups'}->CALC_CGA_SPLIT). This command is only available if a code group could be split up and if it hasn't been used, yet. 

=M_CALC_CGA_FIELDS_P2_F(0)	i{BTN_CGA_MERGE.BMP} f{Merge a formerly split code group}: Use this command to redissolve a previously executed split operation. A split code group can only be merged if none of its descendents are in use, locked or split up themselves. 

=M_CALC_CGA_FIELDS_P2_G(0)	i{BTN_CGA_LOCK.BMP} f{Lock/Unlock a code group}: Use this command to mark a code group as locked or to unlock a previously locked one. A locked code group cannot be occupied and a code group page which contains locked elements, cannot be merged. Use the field f{Description} to note a reason for the locking. 

=M_CALC_CGA_FIELDS_P2_H(0)	i{BTN_CGA_EDIT.BMP} f{Add/Edit a keyway name}: For some brand modules by this command it is possible to add single user defined keyways. They can be recognised by the entry i{ICON_CGA_NEWENTRY.BMP} in the main window. 

=M_CALC_CGA_FIELDS_P3(0)	Below the toolbar in the upper part of the w{Code Group Administration}, the main window with the list of code groups is located. All code groups on the current level are listed here. At the left margin the status of each code group is displayed as an icon: 

=M_CALC_CGA_FIELDS_P3_A(0)	i{ICON_CGA_AVAILABLE.BMP} f{Available}: This code group is free and can be used for a master key system or split into smaller units. 

=M_CALC_CGA_FIELDS_P3_B(0)	i{ICON_CGA_SPLIT.BMP} f{Split}: This code group has been split into smaller units. It can be merged again if none the new code groups have been used or split up themselves, yet. 

=M_CALC_CGA_FIELDS_P3_C(0)	i{ICON_CGA_USED.BMP} f{Used}: This code group was used for one or several master key systems. The systems which use this code group will be listed in the list Used by in the lower part of the window. 

=M_CALC_CGA_FIELDS_P3_D(0)	i{ICON_CGA_LOCKED.BMP} f{Locked}: This code group has been locked. The reason for the locking should be typed into the field f{Description}. 

=M_CALC_CGA_FIELDS_P3_E(0)	i{ICON_CGA_NEW.BMP} f{New}: This code group can be edited to establish a new, user defined profile. 

=M_CALC_CGA_FIELDS_P3_F(0)	i{ICON_CGA_NETLOCK.BMP} f{Net lock}: This code group is just in use by another user in the network. It cannot be occupied or merged. 

=M_CALC_CGA_FIELDS_P4(0)	Below the main window in the lower part of the dialogue box the status fields are located. The contents of these fields always refers to the selected element in the main window. 

=M_CALC_CGA_FIELDS_P4_A(0)	f{Codegroup / Status}: Name and status of the selected code group are displayed here. 

=M_CALC_CGA_FIELDS_P4_B(0)	f{Description}: Additional information about the selected code group's usage. Type in the text here which should be displayed beside the code group in detailed display modus. 

=M_CALC_CGA_FIELDS_P4_C(0)	f{Occupy / Release}: Press this key to occupy the selected code group for usage by the current master key system or to revoke an existing usage. 

=M_CALC_CGA_FIELDS_P4_D(0)	f{Close}: Press this key to leave the w{Code Group Administration} and to return to the LOCKBASE w{Calculator}. 

=M_CALC_CGA_FIELDS_P4_E(0)	f{Used by}: In this list the master key systems are displayed which currently use the selected code group. Usually every code group is used by only one system. However, if it is unavoidable in a certain case to use twice a code group, with this list for example a geographical separation can be achieved. 

=M_CALC_CGA_FIELDS_P5(0)	Notes: 

=M_CALC_CGA_FIELDS_P5_A(0)	You can also reuse a code group that is using a code group which was already used for another master key system. However, it is strongly recommended not to do so, because by this an unintended locking of keys from other systems can become possible. 

=M_CALC_CGA_FIELDS_P5_B(0)	If you ever have to reuse a code group for some reason, at least a different master key combination should be used for the second system. By this at least you may decrease the probability of unintended lockings. 

=M_CALC_CGA_FIELDS_P5_C(0)	You should never reuse code groups of a central lock system (a universal central cylinder). 

=M_CALC_CGA_SPLIT(0)	How to split up Code Groups 

=M_CALC_CGA_SPLIT_P1(0)	The aim of the w{Code Group Administration} is not only to avoid unintended lockings among different systems, but also to help to portion the range of combinations of a cylinder system in a way, that for each of the different sized master key systems an appropriate amount of combinations can be made available. 

=M_CALC_CGA_SPLIT_P2(0)	The dialogue box w{Split a Code Group} 

=M_CALC_CGA_SPLIT_P3(0)	For this the dialogue box w{Split a Code Group} serves. If more than one methods exist, it offers all currently possible methods of splitting up the selected code group. Which methods do exist depend on the selected brand and code group. 

=M_CALC_CGA_SPLIT_P4(0)	In Fig. 3 three options are available: Splitting through profiles, constant pins and side pins. If splitting through profiles it is changed to the respective next level in the profile tree. If splitting through pins (constant pins and side pins), additionally number and position of the constants have to be defined. These pins will be the constant pins in the resulting code groups (e.g. ''VVVVC' 'VVVV1', 'VVVV3', 'VVVV5', 'VVVV7'). 

=M_CALC_CGA_SPLIT_P5(0)	Notes: 

=M_CALC_CGA_SPLIT_P5_A(0)	To get to know the w{Code Group Administration}, you should experiment with it a little. As long as you have not used a code group for a master key system, you always can undo any disadvantageous structure. 

=M_CALC_CGA_SPLIT_P5_B(0)	Before you start to occupy code groups for your master key systems you should design a system of splitting code groups for yourself, which contains smaller as well as larger code groups. 

=M_CALC_CGA_SPLIT_P5_C(0)	It is always better to try a calculation with a smaller code group first. LOCKBASE calculates faster with smaller code groups and you don't waste combinations which later may be needed for another master key system. 

=M_CALC_KBA(0)	3. Edit the Key Bitting Array 

=M_CALC_KBA_P1(0)	The dialogue box w{Edit Key Bitting Array} 

=M_CALC_KBA_P2(0)	The keyway(s), the key bitting array and the master key combination is to be set in the dialogue box w{Edit Key Bitting Array}. The w{Key Bitting Array} is a table with columns representing the possible cut positions and lines representing the possible cut depths of a cylinder brand. After you selected the brand and code group (see Chap. VII-7, {'Cylinder Brands and Code Groups'}->CALC_BRANDS), you have to edit the w{Key Bitting Array}: 

=M_CALC_KBA_P2_A(0)	Double-click on an element in the w{Group Structure} display or 

=M_CALC_KBA_P2_B(0)	mark an element in the w{Group Structure} display and select m{Edit - Edit Key Bitting Array} or 

=M_CALC_KBA_P2_C(0)	mark an element in the w{Group Structure} display and click on i{BTN_CALC_KBA.BMP} or 

=M_CALC_KBA_P2_D(0)	mark an element in the w{Group Structure} display and press the key k{F4}. 

=M_CALC_KBA_P3(0)	The dialogue box cannot be opened, before the fields f{Brand} and f{Code Group} contain valid data. In the upper area of the dialogue box the active group and its size related to the master key system is displayed to ease the splitting of the key bitting array between the groups. 

=M_CALC_KBA_P4(0)	The dialogue box offers the following entry fields: 

=M_CALC_KBA_P4_A(0)	f{Key Bitting Array}: The bit depths possible according to brand and code group are accessible in this box (from left to right = from bow to tip). In order to limit the bitting array (reserves), delete the bit depths that you do not wish to use for this system, resp. for the marked node or subgroup (press k{Del}). If on calculation this bitting array turns out to be to small, place the cursor in this box, type in additional bitting depths and restart the calculation. LOCKBASE only accepts characters which fit the selected code group. 

=M_CALC_KBA_P4_B(0)	f{Profiles Keys}: This list contains all profiles the chosen code group offers for keys. Select the profile(s) here that should be used in the master key system (either per mouse click or arrow keys k{Up} and k{Down} and the k{Spacebar}). To find a certain profile in the list you can type its name, the focus will move to the repective line if the profile was found. 

=M_CALC_KBA_P4_C(0)	f{Profiles Plugs}: This list contains all profiles the chosen code group offers for cylinders. Select the profile(s) here that should be used in the master key system (either per mouse click or arrow keys k{Up} and k{Down} and the k{Spacebar}). To find a certain profile in the list you can type its name, the focus will move to the repective line if the profile was found. 

=M_CALC_KBA_P4_D(0)	f{Master Key}: This button enables you to select bitting and profile for the master key of a system. The button is only available if the master key system, resp. the node or subgroup has a master key. In this case for the master key you have to determine a profile as well as a bitting depth on each position. The master key combination is marked in colour. The master key profile receives a "+" (plus character). 

=M_CALC_KBA_P4_E(0)	f{Exclusive}: With this you reserve a bitting depth or a profile exclusively for the master key. It then no longer occurs in any change key or interchange key and will not be offered in the subordinate key bitting arrays. An exclusive bit is marked in colour, an exclusive profile is indicated by an asterisk (*). 

=M_CALC_KBA_P4_F(0)	f{Use Rotating Constants}: Check this box if you want to calculate with rotating constants. This method uses a certain number of master key bittings for calculation of key functions by changing (rotating) their positions systematically. Generally this method leads to better calculation results. That is the reason why this box is checked by default. Though there also might be worse results for certain systems or brands. In the field f{Positions} you can enter how many master key positions should be rotated. 

=M_CALC_KBA_P5(0)	In the f{Statistics} area the following information is displayed: 

=M_CALC_KBA_P5_A(0)	f{Group}: Name of the group that is currently edited. 

=M_CALC_KBA_P5_B(0)	f{Relative Size}: Number of key functions compared to the total number of key functions in the entire system (in percent). It makes it easier to rate the amount of variation range needed to calculate the group. 

=M_CALC_KBA_P5_C(0)	f{Number of Functions}: The total number of key functions in this group. 

=M_CALC_KBA_P5_D(0)	f{Number of Cylinders}: The total number of cylinders in this group. 

=M_CALC_KBA_P5_E(0)	f{Number of Interchange Keys}: The number of interchange keys in this group. 

=M_CALC_KBA_P5_F(0)	f{Portion of Interchange Keys}: The portion of interchange keys in relation to the total number of key functions in this group (in per cent). It lets you easier rate the complexity of the group. 

=M_CALC_KBA_P6(0)	To move in the field f{Key Bitting Array}, 

=M_CALC_KBA_P6_A(0)	click on a certain column / line or 

=M_CALC_KBA_P6_B(0)	use the arrow keys k{Left}, k{Right}, k{Up}, k{Down} to move the cursor. 

=M_CALC_KBA_P7(0)	The effect of the button f{Master Key} depends on which entry field is currently active: 

=M_CALC_KBA_P7_A(0)	If the f{Profiles Keys} list is active, you can set up a profile for the master key. Mark a profile and click on the button f{Master Key}. 

=M_CALC_KBA_P7_B(0)	If the f{Key Bitting Array} is active, you can determine the master key bitting. Move the cursor to the position you want to be a master key bit and click on the button f{Master Key}. 

=M_CALC_KBA_P8(0)	Example 

=M_CALC_KBA_P9(0)	The following is an example, how to divide up a certain key bitting array among two subgroups. The system has a top master key, as well as 2 groups, each with a (sub) master key. 

=M_CALC_KBA_P10(0)	i{EXAMPLE_KBA.BMP} 

=M_CALC_KBA_P11(0)	For calculating this master key system a code croup with the constants '41' at the tip of the key was selected, i.e. in column 4 and 5 there are no variations at all. All other variations in these two positions can be selected for other master key systems without having wrong fits (see also Chap. VII-2, {'Code Group Administration'}->CALC_CGA). 

=M_CALC_KBA_P12(0)	In column 3 only 3 depths are varied. One of these (1) is an exclusive master key depth. Since the system is structured we can use the other depths for the 2 group key codes. The top master key has the combination "24141", the (sub) master key 1 "24341", the (sub) master key 2 "24541". In column 3 the position "5" has been deleted from the key bitting array of group 1 and the position "3" has been deleted from the key bitting array of group 2. Therefore no interference between the groups is possible. 

=M_CALC_KBA_P13(0)	To divide up the key bitting array for several groups of one level, take care that at least in !{one column or in the profiles the key bitting arrays do not overlap}. Therefore you have to consider that also the bittings of all superordinated master keys will be built into the cylinders of the subgroups. Because of this the cuts of all superordinated master keys always should be set exclusive in the columns used to separate subgroups, if the groups are not separated by profiles. 

=M_CALC_KBA_P14(0)	To divide by profiles select a code group with several profiles for the entire master key system and then use - for example - one of them for every subgroup. 

=M_CALC_KBA_P15(0)	Security Notes: 

=M_CALC_KBA_P15_A(0)	An exclusive master key bitting enhances the security of a master key system. The shallowest bitting of the master key is most suitable as exclusive bitting because then no master key can be produced by filing down another key. 

=M_CALC_KBA_P15_B(0)	If the w{Code Group Administration} is not included in your LOCKBASE package, it is necessary to administer the used code groups to avoid wrong fits between different master key systems. 

=M_CALC_KBA_P16(0)	Notes: 

=M_CALC_KBA_P16_A(0)	In an analysed, hierarchical system you have to set the key bitting array for each node and subgroup beginning at top level. The key bitting array of an upper element has to include the key bitting array of its subgroups, whereas their key bitting arrays have to differ in at least one position. Then the command m{Edit - Calculate} is available (refer to Chap. VII-4, {'Start/Stop Calculation'}->CALC_CALC). 

=M_CALC_KBA_P16_B(0)	When dividing the key bitting array among the groups of a hierarchical master key system, the f{Statistics} area at the top of this box helps. It designates the statistical share of the group of the total master key system. Furthermore, you can look up the master key codes already allocated in the window of the w{Calculator} on the right, next to this dialogue box. 

=M_CALC_KBA_P16_C(0)	Make sure you keep key bitting arrays as small as possible. LOCKBASE calculates faster and you save resources for future master key systems. 

=M_CALC_KBA_P16_D(0)	In the Key Functions List only that keys are displayed bold which belong to the currently selected subgroup in the w{Group Structure} display. All other entries appear pale. 

=M_CALC_KBA_P16_E(0)	A "-" character appears in the w{Group Structure} display if the key bitting array was set up for a node or parent group, but not yet for all of its subgroups. 

=M_CALC_KBA_P16_F(0)	A "+" character appears in the w{Group Structure} display, if the key bitting array of the group and all of its subgroups was completely set up. 

=M_CALC_CALC(0)	4. Start/Stop Calculation 

=M_CALC_CALC_P1(0)	To start the calculation 

=M_CALC_CALC_P1_A(0)	click on i{BTN_CALC_CALC.BMP} in the toolbar or 

=M_CALC_CALC_P1_B(0)	select the command m{Edit - Calculate}. 

=M_CALC_CALC_P2(0)	You can recognise that LOCKBASE is just calculating a master key system by 

=M_CALC_CALC_P2_A(0)	the "think bubble" i{ICON_CALC_BUBBLE.BMP} beside the entry field f{Code Group}, 

=M_CALC_CALC_P2_B(0)	the f{Calculate} button in the toolbar is pushed, 

=M_CALC_CALC_P2_C(0)	the newly calculated combinations are subsequently filled into the Key Function list down right in the w{Calculator} window. 

=M_CALC_CALC_P3(0)	To stop the calculation 

=M_CALC_CALC_P3_A(0)	click on the toolbar button i{BTN_CALC_CALC_ON.BMP} again or 

=M_CALC_CALC_P3_B(0)	repeat selecting m{Edit - Calculate}. 

=M_CALC_CALC_P4(0)	LOCKBASE always calculates the combinations for the currently selected group in the w{Group Structure} display. If a subgroup is selected, it calculates the combination for this group and all its descendent subgroups, but not for its parent. If you want to calculate a system in whole, be sure to select the root of the tree of groups before starting the calculation. 

=M_CALC_CALC_P5(0)	When the calculation is finished or fails, a message appears. 

=M_CALC_CALC_P6(0)	The command to start the calculation is disabled if you did not yet enter all necessary input (refer to Chap. VII-3, {'Edit the Key Bitting Array'}->CALC_KBA). 

=M_CALC_CALC_P7(0)	Notes: 

=M_CALC_CALC_P7_A(0)	The LOCKBASE w{Calculator} automatically excludes certain combinations from use. To these belong for example more than two equally deep adjacent cuts or four equally deep cuts at all (with five pin brands), cut sequences rising or falling like stairs as well as combinations that cannot be cut due to overlapping. 

=M_CALC_CALC_P7_B(0)	Because the calculation process is performed in the background, you can continue working in LOCKBASE or another Windows program during the calculation. 

=M_CALC_CALC_P7_C(0)	An asterisk (*) in the w{Group Structure} display appears when all key functions of the corresponding group have been calculated. 

=M_CALC_CALC_P7_D(0)	LOCKBASE aborts calculation as soon as it is unable to calculate a combination for a certain key. Because change keys are calculated in a random order of sequence it can happen that LOCKBASE is able to calculate other keys during a consecutive trial, because these keys have a different position in the random sequence now. 

=M_CALC_EDITCODE(0)	5. Edit Combinations 

=M_CALC_EDITCODE_P1(0)	The dialogue box w{Edit Combination} 

=M_CALC_EDITCODE_P2(0)	To prepare a calculation, you can enter additional pre-settings for the key functions' combinations or cylinders' profiles. Proceed as follows: 

=M_CALC_EDITCODE_P2_A(0)	double-click on a single key function or a single cylinder or 

=M_CALC_EDITCODE_P2_B(0)	mark one or multiple key functions or cylinders and press k{Enter} or 

=M_CALC_EDITCODE_P2_C(0)	mark one or multiple key functions or cylinders and choose the command m{Edit - Edit Combination...} or 

=M_CALC_EDITCODE_P2_D(0)	select one or multiple key functions or cylinders and click on i{BTN_CALC_EDITCODE.BMP} in the toolbar or 

=M_CALC_EDITCODE_P2_E(0)	mark one or multiple key functions or cylinders and press the key k{F5}. 

=M_CALC_EDITCODE_P3(0)	The dialogue box w{Edit Combination} opens. 

=M_CALC_EDITCODE_P4(0)	Here you can pre-set or overwrite combination/s and/or profile/s for the selected datasets. 

=M_CALC_EDITCODE_P5(0)	The following data fields are available: 

=M_CALC_EDITCODE_P5_A(0)	f{Combination}: Enter the desired combination here. Use the question mark ('?') for positions, which should be calculated by LOCKBASE. 

=M_CALC_EDITCODE_P5_B(0)	f{Profile}: Enter the desired profile here or use the question mark ('?'). 

=M_CALC_EDITCODE_P5_C(0)	f{Suspend calculation}: Activate this checkbox in order to exclude this key or cylinder temporarily from calculation. 

=M_CALC_EDITCODE_P6(0)	You can use the question mark for any cutting position and profile. You can also use it for only some positions or for no position at all. For cylinders only profiles can be pre-set. The w{Calculator} accepts your settings and tries to calculate the missing data. 

=M_CALC_EDITCODE_P7(0)	If you want to edit several records you can use the asterisk ('*') to keep existing cut positions or the profile unchanged. To do so mark the key functions you would like to edit, open the dialogue box w{Edit Combination} and enter the asterisk for each position to keep unchanged. Enter the question mark at those positions, which should be calculated by LOCKBASE. You can also combine explicit pre-settings at certain positions with the asterisk at other positions. 

=M_CALC_EDITCODE_P8(0)	Notes: 

=M_CALC_EDITCODE_P8_A(0)	Complicated systems can be calculated more efficient and much faster by partly pre-setting combinations the way described above. However, detailed technical knowledge of the used cylinder brand and about calculation methods is required. If wrong or senseless settings were made, LOCKBASE will not be able to calculate the system. 

=M_CALC_EDITCODE_P8_B(0)	Only those combinations can be edited that belong to the active group. These combinations can be recognized by being displayed bold in the key functions resp. cylinders list. 

=M_CALC_EDITCODE_P8_C(0)	As long as keys or cylinders have been excluded from calculation, the calculation cannot be finished completely. E.g. to proceed a transfer of the calculation (see Chap. VII-6, {'Transfer'}->CALC_TRANSFER) first all suspended lockings have to be released and calculated. 

=M_CALC_TRANSFER(0)	6. Transferring calculated Data between Calculator and Data Base 

=M_CALC_TRANSFER_P1(0)	The dialogue Box w{Transfer Calculation} 

=M_CALC_TRANSFER_P2(0)	The m{Transfer} command enables you to transfer calculation results from and to the w{Calculator}: 

=M_CALC_TRANSFER_P2_A(0)	You can either transfer data from the technical data fields of the key function and cylinder data sets to the w{Calculator} or 

=M_CALC_TRANSFER_P2_B(0)	from the w{Calculator} to the technical data fields of the key function and cylinder data sets. 

=M_CALC_TRANSFER_P3(0)	To transfer data 

=M_CALC_TRANSFER_P3_A(0)	click on i{BTN_CALC_TRANSFER.BMP} in the toolbar or 

=M_CALC_TRANSFER_P3_B(0)	select the command m{Edit - Transfer...}. 

=M_CALC_TRANSFER_P4(0)	The dialogue box w{Transfer Calculation} opens. It contains the following option buttons: 

=M_CALC_TRANSFER_P4_A(0)	f{Import}: Select Import and press f{OK}. All technical data of the of the key function and cylinder data sets are transferred to the w{Calculator}. The import function enables you e.g. to let LOCKBASE calculate the expansion of a manually calculated system. 

=M_CALC_TRANSFER_P4_B(0)	f{Modification Report}: Click on this button and then f{OK} to get a modification report of keys and cylinders changed by a new calculation before data transfer. Each key and cylinder to be altered will be listed, and it will be displayed, whether key combinations resp. cylinder pinnings or profiles are to be changed. From this report you can decide, whether you accept the calculation or you rather wish to change it again. 

=M_CALC_TRANSFER_P4_C(0)	f{Export}: Select Export and press f{OK}. Then the calculation results are transferred from the w{Calculator} to the technical data fields of the key function and cylinder data sets. 

=M_CALC_TRANSFER_P5(0)	The window below shows messages about the transfer state. If it is finished you can close the dialogue box with f{OK}. 

=M_CALC_TRANSFER_IMPORT(0)	Steps to Import manually calculated Systems 

=M_CALC_TRANSFER_IMPORT_P1(0)	The following describes, how to import a manually or otherwise calculated system to the LOCKBASE w{Calculator}. 

=M_CALC_TRANSFER_IMPORT_P1_A(0)	The connections between key functions and cylinders as well as the combinations and keyways of the key function data sets should already be established with the w{System Matrix}->MTRX_CONNECT or the w{Data Lists}->LST_CONNECT. 

=M_CALC_TRANSFER_IMPORT_P1_B(0)	Change to the w{Calculator} and enter brand and code group in the corresponding fields. If the w{Code Group Administration} is included in your LOCKBASE package select a code group here (refer to Chap. VII-2, {'Code Group Administration'}->CALC_CGA). 

=M_CALC_TRANSFER_IMPORT_P1_C(0)	Select the command m{Edit - Transfer...} and import the technical data to the w{Calculator}. LOCKBASE reconstructs the key bitting array of the system from the imported key combinations. If you have the w{System Designer}, you can let it detect a possibly existing group structure (refer to Chap. VIII-1, {'Analysing Master Key Systems'}->DSGN_ANALYSE). 

=M_CALC_TRANSFER_IMPORT_P1_D(0)	Recalculate the system (see Chap. VII-1, {'Steps to calculate a Master Key System'}->CALC_STEPS). LOCKBASE checks the current calculation and detects and reports eventually existing wrong fits. 

=M_CALC_BRANDS(0)	7. Cylinder Brands and Code Groups

=M_DSGN(0)	VIII. The System Designer 

=M_DSGN_P1(0)	The window w{System Designer}: w{Group Structure} view (a), f{Statistics} area (b), f{Subgroups} area (c), f{Group Data} area (d) 

=M_DSGN_P2(0)	To open the w{System Designer}, 

=M_DSGN_P2_A(0)	click on i{BTN_MAIN_DSGN.BMP} in the toolbar or 

=M_DSGN_P2_B(0)	select the command m{Window - Open System Designer} or 

=M_DSGN_P2_C(0)	choose the hotkey k{Ctrl+D}. 

=M_DSGN_P3(0)	The w{System Designer} is a tool which serves you for 

=M_DSGN_P3_A(0)	planning master key systems with a hierarchical group structure, 

=M_DSGN_P3_B(0)	analyse master key systems already entered for their group structure and 

=M_DSGN_P3_C(0)	rationally enter key, cylinder and door data sets together with their corresponding connections. 

=M_DSGN_P4(0)	Hierarchically structured master key systems are more secure and lower on wear than unstructured ones since as a rule less material has to be built into the cylinders. 

=M_DSGN_P5(0)	Handling the System Designer 

=M_DSGN_P6(0)	The w{System Designer} window contains 4 areas: 

=M_DSGN_P6_A(0)	At the left side the w{Group Structure} view displays the structure of the master key system. It is provided that the system was analysed and has got a hidden hierarchical structure. 

=M_DSGN_P6_B(0)	Up right the area f{Statistics} is displayed. It shows statistical data to the group which is marked in the w{Group Structure} view. The area f{Statistics} contains no entry fields. 

=M_DSGN_P6_C(0)	In the middle of the right side the area f{Subgroups} is located. It contains a subgroups' list and buttons to edit the w{Group Structure}. In the list f{Subgroups} all groups are listed, which are below the marked group in the window w{Group Structure}. 

=M_DSGN_P6_D(0)	Down right the area f{Group Data} is located. Here the data of the selected group in the window w{Group Structure} can be edited. 

=M_DSGN_P7(0)	Inside of the w{System Designer} window a mouse-click or the k{Tab} key moves from one entry area to the next. You can use the hotkeys of the entry fields as well. 

=M_DSGN_P8(0)	Notes: 

=M_DSGN_P8_A(0)	Editing data sets, except master key and central cylinder, is only possible if not a node but a subgroup was selected. 

=M_DSGN_P8_B(0)	Analysing or merging of subgroups does not create or delete connections between key functions and cylinders. 

=M_DSGN_ANALYSE(0)	1. Analysing Master Key Systems 

=M_DSGN_ANALYSE_P1(0)	To analyse the master key system, 

=M_DSGN_ANALYSE_P1_A(0)	press button f{Analyse} in the f{Subgroups} area of the w{System Designer}. 

=M_DSGN_ANALYSE_P2(0)	In the case of large master key systems the analysis can take a while. If existing, LOCKBASE detects the hierarchical structure of the system: What key functions and cylinders build groups regarding to their connections, what contain further subgroups? 

=M_DSGN_ANALYSE_P3(0)	If the master key system was already analysed, the button f{Analyse} is disabled. It is of advantage but not necessary to analyse a master key system for calculation. An analysis can be reversed via f{Merge}. 

=M_DSGN_ANALYSE_GROUPTREE(0)	Group Structure View 

=M_DSGN_ANALYSE_GROUPTREE_P1(0)	Via analyses LOCKBASE checks for groups and group hierarchy in a master key system: 

=M_DSGN_ANALYSE_GROUPTREE_P1_A(0)	What key functions and cylinders build groups regarding to their connections, what contain further subgroups? 

=M_DSGN_ANALYSE_GROUPTREE_P1_B(0)	Which groups contain a master key? 

=M_DSGN_ANALYSE_GROUPTREE_P1_C(0)	Which groups contain a central cylinder? 

=M_DSGN_ANALYSE_GROUPTREE_P1_D(0)	How many and what keys are interchange keys in a group? 

=M_DSGN_ANALYSE_GROUPTREE_P2(0)	After an analysis has been processed or when the system was created by the w{System Designer}, the structure of the system is displayed in the window w{Group Structure} of the w{System Designer} and also in the w{Calculator}->CALC. Then the button f{Analyse} is disabled as long as no data sets are added or deleted and no connections are changed. 

=M_DSGN_ANALYSE_GROUPTREE_P3(0)	A master key systems group structure 

=M_DSGN_ANALYSE_GROUPTREE_P4(0)	Superordinated groups, also called 'nodes', are displayed oval in the w{Group Structure} view. They contain master keys as well as central cylinders. Subgroups are represented rectangularily. They contain possible master-, interchange- and change keys as well as cylinders. The master key of a subgroup is displayed as a interchange key in the f{Group Data} area's list f{Interchange Keys} of the superordinated group. 

=M_DSGN_ANALYSE_GROUPTREE_P5(0)	Groups are separated if no key of a group operates a cylinder of the any other group. Looking at the data shown below, LOCKBASE analyses 2 groups: Neither cylinder "C05" is operated by key "K01", "K02", "K03", "K04", nor key "K05" operates cylinder "C02", "C03" or "C04". 

=M_DSGN_ANALYSE_GROUPTREE_P6(0)	Analysing this matrix would result in two subgroups 

=M_DSGN_ANALYSE_GROUPTREE_P7(0)	Depending on what element is marked in the w{Group Structure} view, the contents of f{Statistics}-, f{Subgroups}- and f{Group Data} area change. 

=M_DSGN_ANALYSE_STATISTICS(0)	Statistics Area 

=M_DSGN_ANALYSE_STATISTICS_P1(0)	In the f{Statistics} area a set of status information about the currently selected group is displayed which can serve to predict eventually occurring problems for later calculation. 

=M_DSGN_ANALYSE_STATISTICS_P1_A(0)	f{Group}: Name of the group that is currently edited. 

=M_DSGN_ANALYSE_STATISTICS_P1_B(0)	f{Relative Size}: Number of the groups' key functions compared to the systems' total number of key functions (in percent). It makes it easier to rate the amount of variation range needed to calculate the group. 

=M_DSGN_ANALYSE_STATISTICS_P1_C(0)	f{Number of Key Functions}: The number of key functions in this group. 

=M_DSGN_ANALYSE_STATISTICS_P1_D(0)	f{Number of Cylinder Functions}: The number of cylinder functions in this group. 

=M_DSGN_ANALYSE_STATISTICS_P1_E(0)	f{Number of Cylinders}: The number of cylinders in this group. 

=M_DSGN_ANALYSE_STATISTICS_P1_F(0)	f{Number of Interchange Keys}: The number of interchange keys in this group. 

=M_DSGN_ANALYSE_STATISTICS_P1_G(0)	f{Portion of Interchange Keys}: The portion of interchange keys in relation to the total number of key functions in this group. It lets you easier rate the complexity of the group. 

=M_DSGN_ANALYSE_SUBGROUPS(0)	Subgroups Area 

=M_DSGN_ANALYSE_SUBGROUPS_P1(0)	All groups of the marked element in the window w{Group Structure} are listed in the f{Subgroups} list. 

=M_DSGN_ANALYSE_SUBGROUPS_P1_A(0)	f{Append...}: With this you add a subgroup to the selected element. If the marked element is a node, it gets a further subgroup, if it is a subgroup itself a further subgroup is added to it (whereby the marked subgroup becomes a node). The dialogue box w{Append Group} appears where you can entry the subgroup's data (refer to Chap. VIII-2, {'Establishing Groups'}->DSGN_SETUP_ADD). 

=M_DSGN_ANALYSE_SUBGROUPS_P1_B(0)	f{Insert...}: This button is only available if in the w{Group Structure} a node is marked and if in the f{Subgroups} list a group is marked. The button adds a subgroup to the marked node and inserts it in the list f{Subgroups}. The marked subgroup and all following ones are renumbered. 

=M_DSGN_ANALYSE_SUBGROUPS_P1_C(0)	f{Multiply...}: This button is only available if in the w{Group Structure} a node is marked and if in the f{Subgroups} list a group is marked. The button allows to multiply the selected sub group on the same level, i.e. to create any number of copies of this group and its sub groups (see Chap. VIII-2, {'Multiply groups'}->DSGN_SETUP_MULTIPLY). 

=M_DSGN_ANALYSE_MERGE(0)	Redissolve an Analysis 

=M_DSGN_ANALYSE_MERGE_P1(0)	With the w{System Designer} you can also redissolve a master key system's group structure. 

=M_DSGN_ANALYSE_MERGE_P2(0)	Select in the f{Subgroups} area 

=M_DSGN_ANALYSE_MERGE_P2_A(0)	the button f{Merge}. 

=M_DSGN_ANALYSE_MERGE_P3(0)	This button is available if 

=M_DSGN_ANALYSE_MERGE_P3_A(0)	the system was analysed and a hierarchical structure was found and (see Chap. VIII-2) 

=M_DSGN_ANALYSE_MERGE_P3_B(0)	a node is marked in the window w{Group Structure} and 

=M_DSGN_ANALYSE_MERGE_P3_C(0)	more than one entry in the list f{Subgroups} is selected. 

=M_DSGN_ANALYSE_MERGE_P4(0)	If all subgroups of a node are merged, the node itself will become a subgroup of the superordinated node. Furthermore the button f{Analyse} becomes available again. 

=M_DSGN_ANALYSE_MERGE_P5(0)	Note: 

=M_DSGN_ANALYSE_MERGE_P5_A(0)	Analysing and merging a group structure does not set or remove connections between key functions and cylinders. 

=M_DSGN_SETUP(0)	2. Set up Master Key Systems using the System Designer 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_P1(0)	Besides analysing existing master key systems you can use the w{System Designer} to create new hierarchical structured systems. 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_P2(0)	After executing the command m{File - New} the w{Group Structure} view contains only the system root, the rectangle with the system number. Consult with your customer what structure the master key system should have. During establishing a new system using the w{System Designer} you are not bound to a special order of sequence. 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_ADD(0)	Establishing Groups 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_ADD_P1(0)	Dialogue box w{Append Group} 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_ADD_P2(0)	With the button f{Append} in the f{Subgroups} area of the w{System Designer} you add a subgroup at the marked group in the w{Group Structure} view. With f{Insert} you insert a group before the marked subgroup in the w{Group Structure} view. With f{Add Data Sets} you add data to the marked group in the w{Group Structure}. 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_ADD_P3(0)	The dialogue boxes w{Append Group} resp. w{Insert Group} resp. w{Add Data Sets} opens. They have identical entry fields: 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_ADD_P3_A(0)	f{Master Key}: With this you set up a master key that is automatically connected to all cylinders of the group, and actually also to those which you are later going to add to the group with the w{System Designer}. 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_ADD_P3_B(0)	f{Central Cylinder}: With this you set up a central cylinder which is automatically connected to all keys of the group, and actually also to those you are later going to add to the group with the w{System Designer}. 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_ADD_P3_C(0)	f{Interchange Keys}: In this area you add interchange keys to the group if an automatic numbering has been determined using the entry fields f{From} and f{To}. Press the corresponding f{Edit (3)} button to open the dialogue box w{Pattern Interchange Key} and define a create pattern for the interchange keys. Interchange key functions are solely connected to possibly already existent central cylinders. 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_ADD_P3_D(0)	f{Cylinders}: In this area you add cylinder data sets to the group if an automatic numbering has been determined using the entry fields f{From} and f{To}. Press the f{Edit (4)} button to open the dialogue box w{Pattern Cylinder} and define a create pattern for the cylinders. Cylinders are automatically connected to possibly already existing master key functions. 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_ADD_P3_E(0)	f{Change Keys}: If you have set up cylinders, with this check box you can establish change keys for the cylinders. Press the f{Edit (5)} button to open the dialogue box w{Pattern Change Key} and define a create pattern for the change keys. LOCKBASE automatically produces as many change key functions as cylinders that have been set up and connects each key function to one cylinder as well as to possibly existing central cylinders. 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_ADD_P3_F(0)	f{Doors}: With this check box you can set up door data sets if you have set up cylinders. Press the f{Edit (6)} button to open the dialogue box w{Pattern Door} and define a create pattern for the doors. LOCKBASE automatically produces as many doors as cylinders have been produced and connects each cylinder to one door. 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_ADD_P3_G(0)	f{Edit}: These buttons are made to define create patterns for the new data sets. They are only available if a valid start and end value was entered or the corresponding check box is activated. The f{Edit} buttons open one of the dialogue boxes w{Master Key}->DSGN_SETUP_MASTERKEY, w{Central Cylinder}->DSGN_SETUP_CENTRALLOCK or one of the w{Pattern...}->DSGN_SETUP_PATTERN dialogue boxes. In the dialogue box w{Pattern...} you can also select one or more data fields, where LOCKBASE inserts the serial number compiled from the fields start value and end value. 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_ADD_P4(0)	Notes: 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_ADD_P4_A(0)	If the value in entry field f{To} is smaller than the value in entry field f{From}, no data sets will be created. 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_ADD_P4_B(0)	For calculation of a master key system no key copies are necessary. 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_ADD_P4_C(0)	It is unlikely that all cylinders of a group have got the same type, length and colour. 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_ADD_P4_D(0)	Instead of the button f{@ Serial No.} you could also use the key k{@} on your keyboard. Usually a key has got @ as the third character on it. To enter it, press k{AltGr+@}. 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_MULTIPLY(0)	Multiplying groups 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_MULTIPLY_P1(0)	The dialogue box w{Multiply subgroup} 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_MULTIPLY_P2(0)	Using the function 'Multiply' you can create any number of copies of an existing group. Variables can be used, which allows an individual numbering of the new groups. 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_MULTIPLY_P3(0)	The button f{Myltiply...} area opens the dialogue box w{Multiply subgroup}. The dialogue offers the following entry fields: 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_MULTIPLY_P3_A(0)	f{Group numbering}: Write the start value of the group numbering into the field f{From} and the end value into the field f{To}. By these settings you also define the number of groups to create. The group serving as copy template will be taken into account when numbering, i.e. if the end value is equal to the start value, no new groups will be created at all. 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_MULTIPLY_P3_B(0)	f{Text replacements}: In this area up to two text replacements can be defined, which should be processed on the template group. Enter the text to replace in the fields f{Replace} resp. f{And}. In the assorted fields f{by} enter the respective new text. Here you can also use the placeholder for the group number '@' (see above, fields f{From} and f{To}). This way a group specific numberig of keys and cylinders is possible. If you enter a letter direclty behind the placeholder (e.g. '@A'), this letter acts as the start value for the group numbering instead of the value in f{From} (i.e. for example 'A', 'B', 'C' instead of '1', '2', '3', etc.). The text replacements will be applied to the fields f{Function} and f{Designation} of the {key function}->DLG_DATA_FUNC record, f{Number} and f{Door Designation} of the {cylinder}->DLG_DATA_CYL record and all data fields of the {door}->DLG_DATA_DOOR record. 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_MULTIPLY_P4(0)	Example 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_MULTIPLY_P5(0)	You may have to create a master key system for an object with three buildings with five floors each. Each floor has 10 flats, for which a cylinder with three keys is needed in each case. Each floor and each building has a central entry, which should be opened only by the assorted flats. Keys and cylinders should be numbered according the pattern [building][floor][flat] = [1-3][A-E][1-10]. 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_MULTIPLY_P6(0)	Proceed as follows to create the system: 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_MULTIPLY_P6_A(0)	Create a new, empty master key system and change to the w{System Designer}->DSGN. 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_MULTIPLY_P6_B(0)	In the area f{Sub Groups} press the button f{Append...} and create a sub group, which has only a central lock (see Chap. VIII-2, {'Establishing Groups'}->DSGN_SETUP_ADD). This group will represent a building. For the central lock (vgl. Chap. VIII-2, {'Central Cylinder'}->DSGN_SETUP_CENTRALLOCK) in the field f{Number} enter '[B]Z'. 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_MULTIPLY_P6_C(0)	Select the new group '1' and for this group again create another sub group (button f{Append...} in the area f{Sub Groups}). This new group represents a floor and should have a central cylinder and 10 cylinders with change keys (f{Cylinder}, f{From}=1, f{To} = 10). In the field f{Number} of the central cylinder enter '[B][F]Z' and in the fields f{Number} of the cylinder and f{Function} of the change key enter '[B][F]@'. In the field f{Description} of the change key type 'Flat [B][F]@' and in the field f{No. of Keys} type '3'. 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_MULTIPLY_P6_D(0)	Now you should have a system with a group '1' at level 1 and a subgroup '1.1' at level 2. Now select group '1' in the w{Group Structure} window and susequently mark entry '1.1' in the list of f{Sub Groups}. The button f{Multiply...} should be available now. 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_MULTIPLY_P6_E(0)	In the next step you multiply the floors. Press the button f{Multiply...} and in the dialogue w{Multiply subgroup} enter the following: f{From}=1, f{To}=5, f{Replace}='[F]' and f{by}='@A'. The fields in the second line in the area f{Text replacements} should be left empty. Press f{OK} to proceed the multiplication. Afterwards you should find five subgroups '1.1' to '1.5' under group '1'. 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_MULTIPLY_P6_F(0)	The last step is to multiply the buildings. In the w{Group Structure} window select the root of the tree (contains the system number). This lets appear group '1' in the list of f{Sub Groups}. Mark the entry '1' here, press again the button f{Multiply...} and enter the following in the dialogue w{Multiply subgroups}: f{From}=1, f{To}=3, f{Replace}='[B]' and f{by}='@'. The other fields again should be left empty. Press f{OK} to proceed the multiplication of the buildings. Now the system should be created completely and all the variables used should be resolved. 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_MULTIPLY_P7(0)	Notes: 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_MULTIPLY_P7_A(0)	Also groups can be multiplied, which have not been created and specified by the w{System Designer}, but by the w{System Matrix}->MTRX or the w{Lists View}->LST. This way also more complex patterns can be created and multiplied. 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_MULTIPLY_P7_B(0)	The multiplication function can also be used to create smaller, repetitive patterns within a group. To do so first create a soubgroup representing the pattern, then multiply it and finally merge back the created subgroups into the original group (see Chap. VIII-1, {'Redissolve an Analysis'}->DSGN_ANALYSE_MERGE). 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_EDIT(0)	Editing Group Data 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_EDIT_P1(0)	This area of the w{System Designer} window displays the data of the current selected element in the w{Group Structure} window. You can add and edit data or delete the entire group. 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_EDIT_P1_A(0)	f{Name}: This entry field allows to change the group's name. When adding a new subgroup, LOCKBASE automatically creates a name for it which designates the new group's position in the hierarchy. 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_EDIT_P1_B(0)	f{Master Key}: This check box displays if a master key for the marked element already exists. If not, you can activate the check box to create a master key. The dialogue box w{Master key}->DSGN_SETUP_MASTERKEY opens to take in the data. The new master key is automatically connected to all cylinders of the marked element (subgroup, node or the entire system), even to those you set up later. If the box is already activated, you can deactivate it to delete the master key. 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_EDIT_P1_C(0)	f{MK}: This button is only available if the check box f{Master Key} is activated. It is used to edit the master key's data. The dialogue box for editing a w{Key Function} appears (see Chap. IV-1, {Key Function Data Sets}->DLG_DATA_FUNC). 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_EDIT_P1_D(0)	f{Central Cylinder}: This check box displays if a central cylinder for the marked element already exists. If not, you can activate the check box to create a central cylinder. The dialogue box w{Central Cylinder}->DSGN_SETUP_CENTRALLOCK opens to take in the data. A central cylinder is automatically connected to all keys of the marked element (group, node or entire system), even to those you set up later. If the box is already activated, you can deactivate it to delete the central cylinder. 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_EDIT_P1_E(0)	f{CC}: This button is only available if the check box f{Central Cylinder} is activated. It is used to edit the central cylinder's data. The dialogue box for editing a w{Cylinder}->DLG_DATA_CYL appears. 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_EDIT_P1_F(0)	f{Add Data Sets}: With this button you add key functions, cylinders, interchange keys and doors to a master key system's subgroup. In an analysed, hierarchical master key system, this button is only available if a subgroup, not a node, is marked. The dialogue box w{Add Data Sets}->DSGN_SETUP_ADD opens. Keys, cylinders and interchange keys are automatically connected to central cylinders, respectively master keys, if existent. 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_EDIT_P1_G(0)	f{Delete}: With this button you delete all key function, cylinder and door data sets which belong to the element marked in the group display. If you delete a node, only the possibly existing central cylinder or master key will be deleted, not the subgroups' data. Unlike the w{System Matrix}->MTRX or the w{Data Lists}->LST you don't have to disconnect the data sets. You cannot delete the system root. 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_EDIT_P1_H(0)	f{Connect...}: This button is to connect a interchange key to cylinders of its group. It is only available if there is a selected entry in the list f{Interchange Keys} and a subgroup is marked in the w{Group Structure} window. The dialogue box w{Connect}->DLG_DATA_CONNECT appears. 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_MASTERKEY(0)	Master Key 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_MASTERKEY_P1(0)	Dialogue box w{Master Key} 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_MASTERKEY_P2(0)	The dialogue box w{Master key} appears when you establish a master key with the w{System Designer} or while creating a subgroup. 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_MASTERKEY_P3(0)	The entry fields are: 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_MASTERKEY_P3_A(0)	f{Function}, f{Description}, f{No. of Keys}: Enter the required data. If you enter nothing in the field f{Function}, LOCKBASE produces a number according to the pattern "MK[group number]". 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_MASTERKEY_P4(0)	Note: 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_MASTERKEY_P4_A(0)	It is not necessary for calculating a master key system to create key copies of a key function. 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_CENTRALLOCK(0)	Central Cylinder 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_CENTRALLOCK_P1(0)	Dialogue box w{Central Cylinder} 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_CENTRALLOCK_P2(0)	The dialogue box w{Central Cylinder} appears when you establish or edit a central cylinder with the w{System Designer} while creating a subgroup. 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_CENTRALLOCK_P3(0)	This dialogue box offers the following entry fields: 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_CENTRALLOCK_P3_A(0)	f{Number}, f{Type}, f{Length}, f{Colour}: Enter the required data. If you enter nothing in the field f{Number}, LOCKBASE produces a cylinder number according to the pattern 'CC[group number]'. 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_PATTERN(0)	The Pattern dialogue Boxes 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_PATTERN_P1(0)	Dialogue box w{Pattern Interchange Key} 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_PATTERN_P2(0)	The dialogue boxes w{Pattern...} appears when you set up or edit interchange keys, cylinders, change keys or doors when appending or inserting a group to a node or adding data into a subgroup with the w{System Designer}. 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_PATTERN_P3(0)	These dialogue boxes accept the data which should appear in every data set to be produced. If the data sets of the group should contain different details in each box, you have to leave the w{Pattern...} dialogue boxes empty and edit the data sets later with the w{System Matrix}->MTRX or the w{Data Lists}->LST. 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_PATTERN_P4(0)	The dialogue Boxes Pattern Change Key and Pattern Interchange Key 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_PATTERN_P5(0)	The dialogue boxes w{Pattern Change Key} and w{Pattern Interchange Key} contain the following entry fields:

=M_DSGN_SETUP_PATTERN_P8(0)	The dialogue Box Pattern Doors 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_PATTERN_P9(0)	The dialogue box w{Pattern Doors} contains the same entry fields like the dialogue box w{Door}->DLG_DATA_DOOR and instead of the button f{Default} the button f{@ Serial No.}: 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_PATTERN_P9_A(0)	f{@ Serial No.}: With this button you insert the @ character at the cursor into one of the entry fields. On the production of the number of data sets stated under f{From} - f{To}, LOCKBASE enters the serial numbering instead of this character. 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_PATTERN_P10(0)	Note 

=M_DSGN_SETUP_PATTERN_P10_A(0)	You can also enter the number symbol @ directly via keyboard. Usually a key on your keyboard has got @ as the third character on it. To enter it, press k{AltGr+@}. 

=M_PRN(0)	IX. Printing Documents 

=M_PRN_P1(0)	With the LOCKBASE Print module you can print out a wealth of various documents (see Chap. IX-4, {'The LOCKBASE Documents'}->PRN_DOC. You can change the documents' layout as well as create new documents. Additionally all documents can be displayed in the print preview before printing (see Chap. IX-2, {'Print Preview and Printing'}->PRN_PRINT). 

=M_PRN_P2(0)	The w{Print Selection Dialogue}->PRN_SELECT shows all documents available and allows the selection of a single or multiple documents for printing. You can choose different printers for various documents and create new documents. 

=M_PRN_P3(0)	The w{Print Formatting Dialogue}->PRN_FORMAT helps to format a document. You can adapt title, subtitle, footer, font and line format, page margins etc. according to your wishes. 

=M_PRN_SELECT(0)	1. The Print Selection Dialogue 

=M_PRN_SELECT_P1(0)	The dialogue box w{What shall be printed out?} 

=M_PRN_SELECT_P2(0)	You start the LOCKBASE Print module with 

=M_PRN_SELECT_P2_A(0)	a click on i{BTN_MAIN_PRN.BMP} in the toolbar or 

=M_PRN_SELECT_P2_B(0)	the command m{File - Print} or 

=M_PRN_SELECT_P2_C(0)	the key combination k{Shift+Ctrl+F12}. 

=M_PRN_SELECT_P3(0)	The dialogue box w{What shall be printed out?} appears, where you can choose from among the documents to be printed. In this dialogue you can print documents, watch them in the preview or format them. You can create and adjust new document forms. 

=M_PRN_SELECT_P4(0)	The w{Print Selection Dialogue} contains the following entry fields and control elements: 

=M_PRN_SELECT_P4_A(0)	f{Forms}: Here you find a sorted list of all forms available. You can choose one or multiple forms for the printing or the formatting, for copying or deletion (for the usage of the list see Chap. IV-2, {'Mark Data Sets'}->DLG_USAGE_SELECT). If you like to format, copy or delete a document, you have to select a single form. Also if you wish to print labels, you have to choose a single form. 

=M_PRN_SELECT_P4_B(0)	f{Printer}: This field shows the printer to use for the selected documents. If different printer settings were assigned to the documents, no printer will be displayed and you will not be able to print or preview. In this case you have to print in several steps or modify the printer settings in the w{Print Formatting Dialogue} (see Chap. IX-2, {'The Print Formatting Dialogue'}->PRN_FORMAT). 

=M_PRN_SELECT_P4_C(0)	f{Output Range}: If you like to print out a part of the data sets only, you can set a pre-selection here (according to the production date or the date of alteration). The offered data is depending on the documents selected in the list f{Forms}. The list f{Data Sets} will be filled only with those data sets that correspond to the pre-selection. If you don't want a limiting pre-selection or if you would like to undo an existing pre-selection, choose 'All'. 

=M_PRN_SELECT_P4_D(0)	f{Data Sets}: This list contains all data sets of the corresponding data stock that correspond to the pre-selection (see f{Output Range}). The data sets that shall be printed, have to be marked. You can enlarge or change the selection manually (see Chap. IV-2, {'Mark Dats Sets'}->DLG_USAGE_SELECT). 

=M_PRN_SELECT_P4_E(0)	f{Close}: This button closes the w{Print Selection dialogue}. The selected documents will not be printed, but formatting alterations will be saved. 

=M_PRN_SELECT_P4_F(0)	f{Print}: The chosen documents will be printed (see Chap. IX-3, {'Start Printing'}->PRN_PRINT_PRINT). Afterwards the w{Print Selection dialogue} will be closed. This button will only be available, if a valid printer has been selected (see f{Printer}). 

=M_PRN_SELECT_P4_G(0)	f{Preview}: The selected documents will be displayed in the print preview (see Chap. IX-3, {'Print Preview'}->PRN_PRINT_PREVIEW). This button will only be available, if a valid printer has been selected (see f{Printer}). 

=M_PRN_SELECT_P4_H(0)	f{Format...}: This button opens the w{Print Formatting dialogue} (see Chap. IX-2, {'The Print Formatting Dialogue'}->PRN_FORMAT). There you can change the formatting of a selected document, e.g. font and line format, title, subtitle, footer etc. This button will only be available, if a single form has been chosen. 

=M_PRN_SELECT_P4_I(0)	f{Copy}: The selected document will be copied. Before, a security query appears. Through that copy function you can set up a variant of an existing document or a completely new document. LOCKBASE crates a new form, inserts a new entry in the list f{Forms}, directly below the pattern, and selects it. At first it will be an identical copy of the pattern. Afterwards you should format the new form (button f{Format...}, see Chap. IX-2, {'The Print Formatting Dialogue'}->PRN_FORMAT). 

=M_PRN_SELECT_P4_J(0)	f{Delete}: The selected document will be deleted. Before, a security query appears. Not all documents can be deleted. LOCKBASE takes care that always at least one copy of each document type will be kept. 

=M_PRN_SELECT_P4_K(0)	f{Start Label Print}, f{Line}, f{Column}: These fields will only be visible if a label form has been selected. They help to enter resp. correct the starting position of the label print. In the fields f{Line} and f{Column} you enter at what label position the printing shall start. If you wish to start with the first label at the top left position, the starting position will be line 1, column 1. If labels on the corresponding page have already been printed, enter line and column of the next unused label. 

=M_PRN_SELECT_P5(0)	Notes: 

=M_PRN_SELECT_P5_A(0)	Please check if a valid printer has been chosen. Otherwise you cannot activate the printing or the print preview. Use the selection list f{Printer} to choose a printer. 

=M_PRN_SELECT_P5_B(0)	The buttons f{Format...}, f{Copy} and f{Delete} will not be available at the selection of multiple forms. Please check that only a single form was selected, if you want to enable this function. 

=M_PRN_SELECT_P5_C(0)	Label forms can be printed only one by one because of the usually different form settings and start positions. 

=M_PRN_PRINT(0)	2. Print Preview and Printing 

=M_PRN_PRINT_P1(0)	With the button f{Print} you can start the printing of one or multiple documents from the w{Print Selection Dialogue}->PRN_SELECT at any time. First the dialogue box w{Print} starts, where you can enter last settings (see Chap. IX-2, {'Start Printing'}->PRN_PRINT_PRINT). 

=M_PRN_PRINT_P2(0)	Not to waste paper, however you should choose the button f{Print} not before you entered the correct settings and when you checked your formattings in the w{Print Preview}. 

=M_PRN_PRINT_P3(0)	Therefore you find in the w{Print Selection Dialogue}->PRN_SELECT a button f{Preview} with that you get into the w{Print Preview}->PRN_PRINT_PREVIEW. With this you open the window w{Print Preview}, where you can see what effects cause your font selection, page margin or line format settings. However you cannot edit the adjustments in the window w{Print Preview}.

Provided that the option f{Data Field Description} has been activated, you can enter in the field f{Width} how much space (in millimetres) should be used on the label for the data field description. The field f{'Evaluate Quantity} will only be available, if you have selected the data stock cylinder. If you check this box, as many labels will be printed for each cylinder data set as in the cylinder data set's field f{Number} are displayed (see Chap. IV-1, {'Cylinder Data Sets'}->DLG_DATA_CYL). Otherwise only one label will be printed for each data set. 

=M_PRN_DOC(0)	4. The LOCKBASE Documents 

=M_PRN_DOC_P1(0)	LOCKBASE provides you with a stock of form types to fit the various requirement of different users. On basis of this stock you can generate your own forms and form variants by copying an existing form and adapt its formatting to the wished purpose (see Chap. IX-1, {'The Printing Selection Dialogue'}->PRN_SELECT and Chap. IX-3, {'The Print Formatting Dialogue'}->PRN_FORMAT). 

=M_PRN_DOC_P2(0)	The forms will be saved together with the master key system's data. That means you could create an own set of forms for each master key system. However usually you will save your forms in the format templates that you can assign to existing or new master key system files (working with format templates see Chap. III-1, {'System Cover Sheet'}->MAIN_FILE_COVERSHEET). 

=M_PRN_DOC_P3(0)	In the following you find a documentation of various form types including possibly existing adjustment options that go beyond the general formatting options. 

=M_PRN_DOC_COVERSHEET(0)	System Cover Sheet

=M_PRN_DOC_MTRX_P2_A(0)	f{Layout}: With this selection list you decide if the cylinder or the key function data sets will be printed at the top i.e. in columns or if the system matrix shall be printed as Euro Matrix. In the Euro Format the cylinders' change keys won't be displayed and printed in the keys' list, but appear as columns in the cylinders' list (referring to the Euro Matrix see Chap. VI-1, {'Euro Matrix'}->MTRX_USAGE_EUROMATRIX). 

=M_PRN_DOC_MTRX_P2_B(0)	f{Scaling factor (%)}: You can enter a scaling factor in percent for the print here. The scaling will apply to the selected font sizes, which in consequence will increase or decrease also line hights and columns widths accordingly. The default value is 100%, which means no scaling at all. The scaling factor is usefull to quickly adjust the layout of the matrix, e.g. in case some values exceed their field widths.

=M_GLOSS_COMMAND_P2(0)	By describing a command, first the menu is named in which it can be found and then after a hyphen follows the command name. Additionally, menu and command names are stated in m{bold}. Example: m{File - Open}. 

=M_GLOSS_CONNECTION(0)	Connection 

=M_GLOSS_CONNECTION_P1(0)	Connections describe the relationship between data sets belonging to different data stocks. 

=M_GLOSS_CONNECTION_P2(0)	LOCKBASE administers three types of connections: 

=M_GLOSS_CONNECTION_P2_A(0)	!{Key holders / Keys}: Whath person ownes what key. I.e. a copy of which key function. 

=M_GLOSS_CONNECTION_P2_B(0)	!{Key functions / Cylinders}: What keys operate a certain cylinder? What cylinders are opened by a certain key function? Connections are also named "lockings" in this context. 

=M_GLOSS_CONNECTION_P2_C(0)	!{Cylinders / Doors}: What cylinder is installed in what door? 

=M_GLOSS_CROSSKEY(0)	Interchange Key 

=M_GLOSS_CROSSKEY_P1(0)	A interchange key is a key function that operates two or more differently locking cylinders, but not all of a group or a master key system. Interchange keys determine among other things the group structure of a master key system. 

=M_GLOSS_CROSSKEY_P2(0)	!{See also} Change Key 

=M_GLOSS_DATASTOCK(0)	Data Stock 

=M_GLOSS_DATASTOCK_P1(0)	The data inventory of one kind. LOCKBASE can administer four data stocks: key holders, key functions, cylinders and doors. Furthermore, LOCKBASE performs the administration of the connections of the data stocks to each other. 

=M_GLOSS_DEFAULT(0)	Default 

=M_GLOSS_DEFAULT_P1(0)	Via the command i{BTN_DLG_DEFAULT.BMP} you can preset some or all entry fields of a data set with certain contents. Thus these entry fields don't have to be entered again with the same contents the next time. 

=M_GLOSS_DEFAULT_P2(0)	!{See also:} Chap. V-1, {'Create Data Sets by Setting Defaults'}->LST_EDIT_ADD_DEF 

=M_GLOSS_DIALOGBOX(0)	Dialogue Box 

=M_GLOSS_DIALOGBOX_P1(0)	LOCKBASE opens a dialogue box whenever before the execution of a command additional information or adjustments are necessary. In a dialogue box several entry fields are collated that take this information. 

=M_GLOSS_DIALOGBOX_P2(0)	You reach an entry field in a dialogue box either 

=M_GLOSS_DIALOGBOX_P2_A(0)	by a mouse click on it, e.g. on a button or list field, 

=M_GLOSS_DIALOGBOX_P2_B(0)	with a key combination of k{Alt} and the underlined letter of the name from the entry field, e.g. k{Alt+N} moves you into f{File name}. 

=M_GLOSS_DIALOGBOX_P2_C(0)	in order with the k{Tab} key (in reverse order with k{Shift+Tab}). 

=M_GLOSS_DIALOGBOX_P3(0)	The buttons f{OK}, f{Cancel} and f{Help} are contained in almost all dialogue boxes. 

=M_GLOSS_DIALOGBOX_P3_A(0)	A mouse click on f{OK} (or k{Enter} if the button has a bold frame) executes the command with the selected options. 

=M_GLOSS_DIALOGBOX_P3_B(0)	A mouse click on f{Cancel} (or k{Esc}) interrupts the command and closes the dialogue box. 

=M_GLOSS_DIALOGBOX_P3_C(0)	A mouse click on f{Help} (or k{F1}) shows the help text for the respective dialogue box. 

=M_GLOSS_DIRECTORY(0)	Directory 

=M_GLOSS_DIRECTORY_P1(0)	A directory is a group of files that belong together and which are administered by the operating system under one name. LOCKBASE finds the master key files on the drive by the directory name. 

=M_GLOSS_DIRECTORY_P2(0)	Directories are symbolized by file covers (i{FOLDER_CLOSED.BMP}, opened: i{FOLDER_OPEN.BMP}). 

=M_GLOSS_DIRECTORY_P3(0)	!{See also:} Path 

=M_GLOSS_DOUBLECLICK(0)	Double Click 

=M_GLOSS_DOUBLECLICK_P1(0)	A mouse action: Point with the mouse cursor i{MOUSE_PTR.BMP} to the object you wish to select and press the mouse key (the index finger key, the left for right handed and vice versa) twice quickly in succession without moving the mouse. 

=M_GLOSS_DOUBLECLICK_P2(0)	!{See also}: Click, Drag 

=M_GLOSS_DRAG(0)	Drag 

=M_GLOSS_DRAG_P1(0)	A mouse action: Point with the mouse cursor i{MOUSE_PTR.BMP} to the object you wish to move to another place and press the mouse key (the index finger key, the left for right handed and vice versa), keep it pressed moving the mouse cursor to the place where the object shall be located. There you let go the mouse key. 

=M_GLOSS_DRAG_P2(0)	!{See also:} Click, Double Click 

=M_GLOSS_DRIVE(0)	Drive 

=M_GLOSS_DRIVE_P1(0)	Drives are hardware components on which in contrast to the RAM data can be permanently stored. Floppy disk and hard disk drives are most frequent. Additionally there are CD-ROM drives for large volumes of data, streamers for backing up data and others. 

=M_GLOSS_FILEFORMAT(0)	File Format 

=M_GLOSS_FILEFORMAT_P1(0)	The manner in which data has been stored and ordered !{within} a file. LOCKBASE files have their own format which cannot be processed by any other program. 

=M_GLOSS_FILENAME(0)	File Name 

=M_GLOSS_FILENAME_P1(0)	Data is stored in groups belonging together, so called files. Each file has an explicit name and place of storage (drive and directory, called path), so it can be identified by the computer's operating system. 

=M_GLOSS_FILENAME_P2(0)	File names consist of eight characters, a . (stop) and three further characters, the file name extension. Special symbols (e.g. ? and *) are not admissible. LOCKBASE recognizes the master key system files from the name extension .LBF. Since the name extension is automatically allocated while storing a file for the first time, you do not need to enter it. 

=M_GLOSS_FORMAT_TEMPLATE(0)	Format Template 

=M_GLOSS_FORMAT_TEMPLATE_P1(0)	A format template is a file that will be used by data views, dialogues and print documents as pattern for font and line formatting, etc. LOCKBASE format templates got the file ending '.lbt' and must be saved in the LOCKBASE directory. You can simply create a format template by saving a LOCKBASE file with the ending '.lbt' formatted according to your needs in the LOCKBASE directory. 

=M_GLOSS_FORMAT_TEMPLATE_P2(0)	!{See also:} Chap. III-1, {'Save master key system file under a new name'}->MAIN_FILE_SAVEAS and {'System Cover Sheet'}->MAIN_FILE_COVERSHEET 

=M_GLOSS_GROUPSTRUCTURE(0)	Group Structure 

=M_GLOSS_GROUPSTRUCTURE_P1(0)	i{GROUP_STRUCTURE.BMP} 

=M_GLOSS_GROUPSTRUCTURE_P2(0)	A hierarchically structured master key system consisting of several groups (nodes and subgroups) of keys, e.g. right. Nodes are represented oval, sub groups are represented rectangularily. A subgroup is always at the lowest level of the hierarchy, nodes at the levels above. 

=M_GLOSS_GROUPSTRUCTURE_P3(0)	Groups are distinguished from each other either by their interchange keys or by having their own master key and/or central cylinder. There can be interchange keys within a group, but not between various groups. 

=M_GLOSS_GROUPSTRUCTURE_P4(0)	When a master key system has been analyzed for its group structure, only the rectangularily represented subgroups - the leaves on the tree so to speak - can be edited in the w{System Matrix}->MTRX and in the w{Data Lists}->LST. 

=M_GLOSS_HOTKEY(0)	Hotkey 

=M_GLOSS_HOTKEY_P1(0)	A "hotkey" serves to reach a menu, option, command or entry field in a dialogue box faster than this is possible with the mouse. 

=M_GLOSS_HOTKEY_P2(0)	There are two types of hotkeys: 

=M_GLOSS_HOTKEY_P2_A(0)	Underlined letters in connection with the k{Alt} key (in a menu without k{Alt}). Example: The key combination k{Alt+F} opens the menu m{File}. 

=M_GLOSS_HOTKEY_P2_B(0)	Acceleration keys. They are stated in the menu, but only work if the menu is not opened. Example: The key k{F12} carries out the command m{File - Save As}. 

=M_GLOSS_ICON(0)	Icon 

=M_GLOSS_ICON_P1(0)	A presentation form in Windows. To make space on the screen, windows can be reduced to icons. You can recreate the window as soon as you need it again. 

=M_GLOSS_ICON_P2(0)	The icons for the four LOCKBASE windows: 

=M_GLOSS_ICON_P3(0)	i{4ICONS.BMP} 

=M_GLOSS_KEYCOPY(0)	Key Copy 

=M_GLOSS_KEYCOPY_P1(0)	Key copy means the individual, identical keys belonging to a key function; the samples of a key. 

=M_GLOSS_KEYCOPY_P2(0)	This differentiation is necessary because it can well be that a key function "MK" (master key) is envisaged in a master key system and installed in the cylinders, but whether copies (that means real keys, "MK-1", "MK-2" etc.) have been cut and how many actually been issued is not thus decided. LOCKBASE thus administers key copies subordinate to key functions (refer to Chap. IV-1, {'Key Copies'}->DLG_DATA_KEY). 

=M_GLOSS_KBA(0)	Key Bitting Array 

=M_GLOSS_KBA_P1(0)	The key bitting array is a rectangular table with columns showing the pins and in its lines the possible cutting depths of a cylinder brand. Here applies: (number of cut depths) to the power (number of pins) = (number of theoretical changes). From left to right the designators correspond to the cuts from bow to tip of the key. The key bitting array defines the cuts and profiles available for calculating a master key system. 

=M_GLOSS_KBA_P2(0)	!{See also:} Chap. VII-3 {'Edit the Key Bitting Array'}->CALC_KBA 

=M_GLOSS_MARK(0)	Mark 

=M_GLOSS_MARK_P1(0)	By marking - also called selecting - you determine what the next action should refer to. E.g. the deletion or editing of a piece of data. You can shift the mark with the mouse or the arrow keys. If you wish to mark several elements, for example in order to delete several pieces of data at one time, you can extend the marking by dragging the mouse or by a combination of k{Shift+[Arrow Keys]}. 

=M_GLOSS_MARK_P2(0)	!{See also:} Chap. IV, {'Selecting Data Sets'}->DLG_USAGE_SELECT 

=M_GLOSS_MASTERKEY(0)	Master Key 

=M_GLOSS_MASTERKEY_P1(0)	A master key is a key function that operates all cylinders of a group. If a master key system has got several groups and a key function locks all cylinders of the entire system, it is called a General or Top Master Key. 

=M_GLOSS_MENU(0)	Menu 

=M_GLOSS_MENU_P1(0)	A group of commands. The main menu on the top edge of the window contains for example all subordinate menus as options. In the menu m{File} are all commands which concern the files as a whole (m{Open, Save, Print,...}) whilst in the menu m{Edit} are the commands by which the file contents are edited. 

=M_GLOSS_MOUSEKEY(0)	Mouse Key 

=M_GLOSS_MOUSEKEY_P1(0)	In the LOCKBASE online help as well as in the LOCKBASE manual the term "mouse key" means the forefinger key. This is the left mouse key for right-handers. 

=M_GLOSS_MOUSEKEY_P2(0)	Windows tip: 

=M_GLOSS_MOUSEKEY_P2_A(0)	Left-handers can use the Windows w{Control Panel} (in the m{Start} menu see m{Settings - Control Panel - Mouse - Buttons}) to swap left and right mouse key, so that the right key is the forefinger key. 

=M_GLOSS_NETDRIVE(0)	Netdrive 

=M_GLOSS_NETDRIVE_P1(0)	Not a drive in physical sense, but a directory on another computer's drive which is connected to a network, usually a server computer. On the client computer the server directory appears as a drive. 

=M_GLOSS_NODE(0)	Node 

=M_GLOSS_NODE_P1(0)	Overriding groups in an analyzed master key system are so-called nodes. They can contain master keys, central cylinders and further subgroups. In the w{Group Structure} display in the windows w{System Designer} and w{Calculator}, nodes are displayed as oval whereas subgroups appear as rectangular. 

=M_GLOSS_OPTION(0)	Option 

=M_GLOSS_OPTION_P1(0)	The term 'option' has got two different meanings: 

=M_GLOSS_OPTION_P1_A(0)	a selection option in a menu or dialogue box or 

=M_GLOSS_OPTION_P1_B(0)	an adjustment option which determines the appearance of LOCKBASE in the window. 

=M_GLOSS_PATH(0)	Path 

=M_GLOSS_PATH_P1(0)	The path (another concept: Directory path) designates the logical place where a file is stored (on what drive, in what directory, in what sub-directory?). Example: C:\WINDOWS\LOCKBASE\LBDATA is a path. 

=M_GLOSS_RAM(0)	RAM 

=M_GLOSS_RAM_P1(0)	The RAM (random access memory) is the part of the computer hardware which records data and programs whilst working with the PC. Data is moveable in the RAM but cannot be permanently stored as on a hard disk drive. 

=M_GLOSS_SCROLLBAR(0)	Scroll Bars 

=M_GLOSS_SCROLLBAR_P1(0)	i{SCROLLBAR.BMP} 

=M_GLOSS_SCROLLBAR_P2(0)	Whenever a window or a list is too small to display all the data contained in it, so called scroll bars automatically appear on the bottom and right edges. Mouse users can shift the displayed section. 

=M_GLOSS_SCROLLBAR_P2_A(0)	With a click on the scroll arrows, the screen content moves one line/column into the corresponding direction. 

=M_GLOSS_SCROLLBAR_P2_B(0)	You can drag the scroll box between the scroll arrows. If you let go the mouse key, the screen content moves corresponding to the position between the arrows. 

=M_GLOSS_SCROLLBAR_P2_C(0)	With a click between the scroll arrows and the scroll box the screen content moves one page to the corresponding direction. 

=M_GLOSS_SELECT(0)	Select 

=M_GLOSS_SELECT_P1(0)	Starts an action, e.g. a command from a menu or marking and k{Enter} or by clicking on. 

=M_GLOSS_SELECT_P2(0)	Entries in a list are also selected by marking and k{Enter} or by double clicking with the mouse. 

=M_GLOSS_SELECT_P3(0)	!{See also:} Mark, Drag 

=M_GLOSS_STATUSBAR(0)	Statusbar 

=M_GLOSS_STATUSBAR_P1(0)	i{STATUSBAR.BMP} 

=M_GLOSS_STATUSBAR_P2(0)	The Statusbar at the bottom edge of the screen displays useful information e.g. on effects of a command if the mouse cursor is located on the corresponding menu entry (refer to Chap. III, {'Statusbar'}->MAIN_OPTIONS_STATUSBAR). 

=M_GLOSS_TOOLBAR(0)	Toolbars 

=M_GLOSS_TOOLBAR_P1(0)	The toolbars of: 

=M_GLOSS_TOOLBAR_P1_A(0)	i{TOOLBAR_MAIN.BMP} w{Main Window}, 

=M_GLOSS_TOOLBAR_P1_B(0)	i{TOOLBAR_LST.BMP} w{Data Lists}, 

=M_GLOSS_TOOLBAR_P1_C(0)	i{TOOLBAR_MTRX.BMP} w{System Matrix} and 

=M_GLOSS_TOOLBAR_P1_D(0)	i{TOOLBAR_CALC.BMP} w{Calculator}. 

=M_GLOSS_TOOLBAR_P2(0)	The little buttons serve mouse users to have commands carried out faster. If you wish to know which command is behind a certain symbol, point to it with the mouse and hold the mouse key. An explanation appears in the status line at the bottom of the program window. If you do not wish to carry out the command, drag the mouse down from the symbol before releasing the key. 

=M_GLOSS_UNSORTED(0)	Unsorted 

=M_GLOSS_UNSORTED_P1(0)	Data Sets belonging to certain data stocks can be displayed in different sorting order in the LOCKBASE data lists (refer to Chap. IV-2, {'Line Format and Sorting'}->DLG_USAGE_LINE). If no sorting order has been selected, the data will be shown or printed unsorted according to the sequence they were entered. 

=M_GLOSS_UNSORTED_P2(0)	!{See also:} Chap. IV-2, {'Move Data Sets'}->DLG_USAGE_MOVE 

=M_GLOSS_WINDOW(0)	Window 

=M_GLOSS_WINDOW_P1(0)	In the graphic user interface Windows, "window" means any rectangular screen area in which data belonging together (a program or file) is displayed. 

=M_GLOSS_WINDOW_P2(0)	!{See also:} Scroll Bars 

=M_GLOSS_WRONGFIT(0)	Wrong Fit
